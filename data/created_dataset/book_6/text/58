Whenever I mentioned wanting to watch an
orchestra performance, all my friends, except Christina,
would give me a bored look. Both Christina and I loved
classical music. We enjoyed the complexities of classical
music, which harmonised the sounds from different
instruments into a beautiful piece of music.
Christina and I often attended concerts together.
Sometimes, we got frustrated when we sat near
inconsiderate people. Despite numerous reminders to
switch off their mobile phones, people still refused to do so.
It was irritating when someone's phone rang in the middle
of the concert and interrupted the performance. Sometimes
we would see members of the audience, who were probably
dragged to the concert by their partners, dozing off and
snoring away loudly.
Just last week, Christina and I were at a concert hall
listening to Mozart's concerto when suddenly we heard a
drone coming from behind. At first, we ignored the sound
and concentrated on the music. However, when the
booming sound from the bass guitars diminished, the drone
from behind us became exceedingly loud. Turning around in
irritation, we glared at a man who had dozed off. His head
was tilted backwards and he was even drooling. I was
tempted to wake him up when suddenly the mobile phone
from the pocket of the man next to him rang. The shrill
sound penetrated the hall and the man immediately took
out his phone. To our horror, he started laughing and
chatting on the phone. Unfortunately, we were unable to do
anything about the two men, so we turned around and tried
to enjoy the rest of the performance.
Despite the occasional inconsiderate people in the
audience, Christina and I would often have an engaging time
at the performance. We awlays looked forward to another
performance and hoped that we would not meet any
inconsiderate people there.
