Tick, tick, tick. Screech! I flipped through the script
that my father had given me excitedly. It was his recent
script and it was about a murder. My father works as a
scriptwriter for a huge film production company. He has a
very fascinating occupation and I often get to see his works
played out by glamorous artistes both on stage and on the
silver screen. I have seen all the films he has written and I
love every single one of them. He has even won many
awards for his scripts.

"So what do you think?" my father leaned back in his
seat as he gazed confidently at us. "A prominent artist will
be in this film. I wrote this just for her. I think she's very
suitable for the role."

I nodded my head in approval. As usual, my father
had outdone himself. No matter how good his scripts were,
he always managed to come up with a better one several
months later. However, although it was well written, I knew
that the discussion had not come to an end. There would
still be details that he wanted to iron out and he would turn
to my mother, my sister and me for advice. As usual, we
would become so engrossed in our discussions that we
would not even realise that it was time for dinner. All we
needed were plates of cookies and other snacks to sustain
us.

That night, long after my sister and I had gone to
bed, my father burnt the midnight oil to finish his script.
Once his creative juices flowed, he would not stop writing
regardless of the time.

The next morning, I woke up to see my father with
his head on the coffee table. He had stayed up the whole
night to work on his script. It was worth it. The script was
neatly placedÂ· at the side of the table, ready for the
producers. I knew it would be another successful script.
