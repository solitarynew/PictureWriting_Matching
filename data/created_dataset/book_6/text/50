"Hey, what's that smell coming from outside?" asked
Bobby. "Is someone's barbecued food burning?" Bobby
sniffed in the direction of the kitchen window.
"Let's take a look," suggested Peter inquisitively.
"Maybe someone burnt food while cooking. Could be our
elderly neighbour."
To their horror, it was neither a barbecue nor burnt
food. A fire was already blazing from an apartment across
their block. Black smoke was billowing from the apartment
and the boys could feel the heat of the inferno from across
the block. Some people were trying to evacuate the
occupants living near the burning apartment. Seconds later,
they heard the blaring of sirens as fire engines and an
ambulance pulled up at the foot of the block.
The fire fighters immediately pulled out their hoses
and started spraying at the burning hellhole. Some of the
paramedics were attending to the injured who had inhaled
some smoke. Soon, the police arrived to control the crowd.
They put up barricades to keep the crowd away while some
journalists with their cameras were capturing the valiant fire
fighters controlling the blaze. Bystanders were pointing at
the block and giving their own commentary about the fire.
It took ten minutes before the fire was put out. The
walls around the apartment where the fire had started had
turned black. Dark smoke was still in the air and the choking
smell from the fire still lingered in the air. The injured had
been taken to the hospital and only several curious
onlookers were left at the scene. Peter and Bobby returned
to their room. It had been a frightening sight.
It was indeed an eye-opening experience for the two
boys who were witnessing a fire for the first time. The boys
finally understood why their parents were always so
concerned about being careful and ensuring that a fire does
not break out.
