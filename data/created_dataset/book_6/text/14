I am amazed at how performers can be as calm as a
cucumber and act naturally while performing on stage. They
seem to sail through their performance without any signs of
jitters. I could not be like them. I would often be chided by
my teacher for forgetting my lines and showing visible signs
of nervousness on stage. Luckily, I was given a minor role in
a play so my jumpiness would not have a profound effect on
the performance.
Last year, I had been selected to perform in a play for
my school's Drama Society. Although we put in a lot of time
and effort to rehearse for the play, I was still very nervous
when the day of the actual performance arrived. Even during
stage rehearsals, I felt green around the gills.
The big day finally arrived. Despite being given a pep
talk by my teachers and encouragement by my friends, I still
had butterflies in my stomach. When it was my turn to be on
stage, I nervously walked up on stage and tried to recall
my lines at the same time. Fortunately, my stage fright
disappeared when I began to speak my lines. I finally realised
that it was actually fun to be on stage and it was all right to
be nervous because the feeling would eventually wane as I
performed.
There was indeed a great sense of satisfaction when
we received a standing ovation for our performance. The
approval and enthusiasm on the face of the audience
spurred me to try even better in my next performance.
