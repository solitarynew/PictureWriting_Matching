The Indians do not make up as much of the
population as some other races like the Chinese. However,
many Indian festivals are celebrated. The Indians in
Singapore cover a wide spectrum ranging from the modern
and westernised to the very conservative and traditional.
Yet, all Indians regard Deepavali as their New Year, like the
Lunar New Year is to the Chinese.
Although Deepavali falls in the month of November,
it is considered the start of a New Year for the Indians as
they have a different calendar system from the Gregorian
one. Deepavali is also known as the Festival of Lights as they
believe that their Hindu God overcame evil and darkness
with goodness.
The celebrations start in the early morning with
prayers followed by a meal. Thereafter, wishes and greetings
are exchanged among family members and friends with
more feasts to be followed. Friends visit one another and
exchange well wishes. New clothes are worn and everyone is
in good spirits. The religious ones will go to the temple to
give thanks for blessings received and to ask for guidance for
the coming year. This can be seen by the huge number of
devotees congregating in the temples during this
celebration.
Deepavali is indeed a joyous occasion celebrated by
the Indians. Today, with the constant interaction among the
different races, people from other races also visit their
friends to share in the joy of Deepavali. I too have visited my
Indian friends on this occasion and I usually enjoy trying
their food and chatting with them.
