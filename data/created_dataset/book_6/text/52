Sam and his family were enjoying themselves on a
holiday in the United States. Los Angeles was the first stop
and they were having a whale of a time. Little did they know
that something terrible that was beyond their control would
happen.
After a quick breakfast, they set off for Disneyland,
planning to spend the whole day in Fantasy Park. They had
barely set foot in the park when they felt a tremor. At first,
they thought that some heavy piling works nearby were
causing massive aftershocks, so they carried on with their
plans. Sam and his family continued browsing in the gift
shop, ignoring the tremors. Seconds later, a huge tremor
shook the earth and goods started to tumble off the display
shelves. Screams pierced the air and frightened cries echoed
throughout the place. Sam saw the ground cracking right
before his eyes.

Sam and his family were momentarily stunned. They
did not know what an earthquake was like or how to take
shelter from one. Fortunately, they heard the commanding
voice from one of the guides to go to a nearby earthquake
shelter. They ran as fast as they could, avoiding falling debris
and other panicked visitors at the same time.
Fortunately, Sam and his family managed to take
cover before further disaster could happen. They found out
that some people were killed by falling electricity poles and
some were trampled to death. Sam was glad that he was
safe and sound with his family. It was indeed a horrifying
holiday but they were glad and lucky to be alive.
Sam's parents decided to return to Singapore the
next day. It was indeed a harrowing experience. Sam
wondered how many casualties there were in the
earthquake. He shuddered as he thought of the chaos in the
gift shop that morning.
