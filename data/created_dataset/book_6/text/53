It was eight in the morning and the roads were
jammed with the morning peak hour traffic. Everyone
seemed to be on the road at the same time because they
were on their way to work. However, the delay was causing
the journey to be longer than usual and the cars had slowed
to a crawl.
"What is happening?" Rick said impatiently. "I am
going to be late for my appointment. Why does this have to
happen on the day I'm meeting a new client?"
"Take it easy, dear," Scarlet replied. "There must be
an accident ahead. It must be a serious one too!"
"Why must accidents occur on Mondays?" Rick
complained and began to panic. "It must be those
inconsiderate drivers slowing down to look at the accident.
They are such busybodies," he grumbled as he waved his
arms frantically in the air.
As Rick had predicted, everyone was slowing down to
look at the accident vehicles. It was a five-vehicle pileup and
the accident vehicles were all badly damaged. Some of the
cars were crushed beyond recognition. It was amazing that
the victims were still alive. There were pools of blood
everywhere. Even Rick slowed down to stare at what was
happening. One of the victims was more badly hurt than the
others. She was lying motionlessly by the side of the road.
Several others had sustained head injuries. Blood was oozing
from their wounds and they had to hold on to something or
someone for support. It was an ominous scene.
"I can't believe it!" Rick exclaimed. He had
completely forgotten about his appointment. All he could
think of was the number of injured victims and the large
amount of debris scattered everywhere on the road. "I've
never seen such a tragic accident before." As he drove off,
he could not help worrying about the victims. He wondered
if there would be any deaths in the accident.
