Dear Megan,
Hi! My name is Melissa and I am from Singapore. I
was impressed with your website and am keen to be your
pen-pal. Allow me to tell you something about myself.
I am twelve years old this year and a Primary Six
student at Anza High School. I will be sitting for my Primary
School Leaving Examinations or PSLE, as everyone calls it
here, this year. The PSLE determines which Secondary
school I am eligible to attend and what kind of stream I
would be in. There are basically four types of streams,
namely, Special, Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal
(Technical). The former two streams allow one to complete
one's Secondary education in four years while the latter two
require five years. I hope to do well enough to be in the
Express Stream.
Well, enough about education. I also have many
hobbies. I like reading and drawing but I am more inclined
towards outdoor activities like jogging, soccer and rock
climbing. I love rock climbing the most because it is very
challenging. Although I am generally weaker and smaller in
size, I can climb faster than many others because of my
lightweight and agility. I will be taking part in a rock climbing
competition next week and I hope to win a prize.
I have to pen-off now. I hope to hear from you soon
and become friends with you. Hopefully, we can meet up in
the near future.
Regards,
Melissa Chua
