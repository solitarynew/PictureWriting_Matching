The Olympic Games is held once every four years. It
is the biggest and grandest sports meet where thousands of
athletes come together to compete in many different kinds
of sporting events. These events range from the popular
track and field meets to the graceful synchronised
swimming.
Swimming is one of the most watched sports during
the Olympic Games. Swimmers compete in different races
using different types of swimming strokes. Wearing their
goggles, they get ready to jump into the pool, swimming like
a fish once they are inside. Most of them train for years
before they are good enough to take part in the Olympics.
There are both individual and team races for
swimming. Just yesterday, I watched a team event. It was
the male team relay. With each team member wearing
similar trunks, the different teams waited anxiously for the
relay to start. Jumping about and shaking their arms and legs
vigorously, the swimmers stood at the side of the pool. Once
the horn sounded, the first swimmer from each team dived
into the pool. Some of the better ones swam underwater for
almost half the pool before emerging to breathe. One of the
team was clearly better than the others and by the time the
last swimmer completed the race, none of the others teams
were even close behind. Everyone cheered for the last team
that stumbled in the beginning because one of the
swimmers suddenly went under due to a muscle strain and
subsequently lagged behind the rest. The spectators cheered
and jumped about gleefully when the team they were
rooting for completed the race.
Judging by the number of spectators at the
swimming complexes and the millions of viewers from all
over the world who tune in to watch the swimmers put in
their best efforts, swimming is one of the most popular
sports during the Olympics. Many amateurs look to these
Olympic champions as a source of inspiration.
