It had always been my dream to become a pianist.
However, my mother was hesitant to let me take up piano
lessons initially as she was worried that once my curiosity
wore off, I would lose interest in it. However, after much
begging and persuasion, my mother finally enrolled me for
piano lessons. I was eleven years old then. Although a
pianist usually starts lessons at a much younger age, I was
undeterred and was certain that I would still be able to pick
up the skills quickly.
I enjoyed playing the piano but taking the 
examination was stressful. A lot of practise was necessary
before the examination. Playing the scales, three pieces of
pre-selected music and the oral examination were the three
required sections in the piano examination. I remember the
amount of time I put in before my first examination. I
sacrificed time with my friends and time on the computer.
However, I had no regrets for I was fulfilling my dream of
becoming a pianist.
Sight-reading, which was also part of the oral section,
tested my ability to play an unprepared piece of music. It
was the most tedious part of the examination because I was
only given a few seconds to look at the music score before
playing it to the examiner. While playing the sight-reading
piece, I had to take note of the tempo as well.
The other two sections were relatively easier as they
could be prepared months before hand. However, the
tension in the examination studio sometimes caused me to
stumble on my well-prepared pieces.
The effort I put in for the examination was worth it. I
scored a distinction in the examination and the examiner
commended me on my exceptional skills. I had proven to my
mother that I was truly interested in playing the piano and
that I had the talent for it. Ruffling my hair, she had told me
that she had never felt so proud in her life.
