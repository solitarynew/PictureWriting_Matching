"Come on! The movie is starting! I don't want to miss any part of it!" I yelled as I pushed my friends to walk faster.
Watching films is my greatest joy during my leisure time. I will watch the latest film releases and previews whenever I
can. My friends call me a movie buff and will turn to me for an unofficial but often accurate review of films they are
interested in watching.

Among all the films I have watched, my all-time favourite is still Star Wars. Although I was only five years old
when I first watched it, its story line, characters and special effects captivated me. My favourite part of the movie is the space battle where there are many spaceships fighting against one another using skilful manoeuvres and
impressive weapons. The most amazing thing about the film is that the technology and techniques used are ahead of
their time. Consequently, it has become a benchmark for other moviemakers to follow.

Two decades after its first release, the company that produced the film re-mastered the original version and released an updated version. Naturally, I was one of the first to catch it in the cinema. It was a spellbinding experience to enjoy my favourite film on the big screen once again. I was so impressed and loved it so much that I watched it thrice,
fully savouring it each time.

Star Wars is indeed the best film I have ever seen. I am watching a new Science Fiction film next week. From the
reviews that I have read, it promises to be one of the best Science Fiction films ever made.
