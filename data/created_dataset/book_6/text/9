Dear Diary,
It has been a dreadful day for me today. I was not
only late for school but was rebuked by my teacher as well.
Last night, I stayed up late to watch my favourite wrestling
programme and told myself that I would go to bed at
midnight. Nonetheless, I was carried away and did not
realise it was already three in the morning after the
programme ended.
I was so groggy when I finally crawled into bed that I
forgot to set my alarm clock. When I next opened my eyes,
the alarm clock showed seven thirty. For a second, I thought
that it was a weekend. I called for my mother, but did not
get a reply.
Then, I remembered what had happened the night
before and my mother's words just before she went to bed
last night rang in my ears, 'I've to leave early for work. Set
your alarm clock. I won't be able to wake you up.' A cold
feeling washed over me and I lay unmoving under my
covers. However, seconds later, I jumped out of bed, got
changed and took a taxi to school. My teacher was gnashing
her teeth about my lack of punctuality. Furthermore, I
completely forgot about the homework she had given us last
week that was supposed to be handed up today. I was
scolded yet again for not doing my homework. After that, I
was really down in the dumps.
To add to the problems, I became drowsy after
having a heavy meal during recess and began to doze off
during my Mathematics lesson. I was caught by Mrs Teo, my
teacher, and punished. She made me stand at the back of
the class for the entire lesson.
I learnt a painful lesson today for staying up so late. I
have vowed never to commit such a silly and painful mistake
ever again.
