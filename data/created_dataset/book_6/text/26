The Internet has taken the world by storm. It has
changed the world and has transcended barriers. As a result,
it now plays a major role in shrinking the world, making it a
global village. Everyone, from even the remotest part of the
world is able to access anything they want. Christopher is no
different.
Christopher likes to use the Internet. He often uses it
to search for information for school assignments. Sometimes
he also uses it to find out about current affairs and news
about his favourite stars. Christopher spends more than ten
hours on the Internet every week. He uses the Internet
every evening after dinner and on weekends as well.
However, as Christopher is still young, his parents
often supervise him when he is on the Internet. As there are
no proper regulatory mechanisms to police cyberspace
usage, his parents will guide him and give him their views
about the websites that he goes to. Even though they are
guiding him, they hope that he will eventually be discerning
enough to search for whatever he needs independently. For
the time being, they will still monitor his usage of the
Internet.
Christopher does not mind having his parents with
him when he is using the Internet. He enjoys communicating
with them and listening to their opinions. Sometimes, they
will even tell him more than what he can find on the
Internet. As his parents are more knowledgeable than he is,
they can sometimes tell him whether the information he
gathers from the Internet is reliable or not.
Christopher enjoys using the Internet. Its potential as
an information base is infinite. He feels that it is probably
the greatest innovation invented so far.
