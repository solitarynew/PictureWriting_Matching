A few years ago, Victor suffered from a mild stroke.
Fortunately, he was able to resume his normal lifestyle after
a few months. However, those few months spent confined
in the hospital and later at home opened his eyes to the
importance of a healthy lifestyle.
To save his own life and to prevent himself from
having to pay hefty medical bills, Victor began exercising
regularly. As he never had a fondness for exercising, he
decided to join a group of his neighbours in the park for tai
chi every morning. Even before breakfast, the group made
up mostly of men, would twist and turn gently in uniform.
Although the steps looked simple, it was actually quite
challenging. An activity which he had often looked down on
as meant for weaklings, proved quite a task for him initially.
Although it was not as vigorous or strenuous as other
outdoor activities like tennis and running, it also required a
lot of stamina.
There were six other people in the group and two
who served as instructors. With the encouragement of the
others in the group, Victor began turning up for lessons
regularly. Instead of his usual business suits, Victor donned a
pair of loose pants and a comfortable T-shirt. He also made
sure that he wore the appropriate shoes for tai chi. Everyone
stood in rows facing the two instructors. The instructors
would teach the steps one at a time and the others would
mimic them. The instructors also kept a look out for those
who could not follow the lesson. They would then coach the
person individually. There was not much talking when the
lesson was on but the minute it was over, everyone would
gather in groups to chat, some proceeding to the nearby
coffee shop for a drink.
Victor was glad that he had decided to embrace a
healthy lifestyle. It was a complete change from his previous
lifestyle, but he was beginning to get used to it. In fact, his
latest visit to the doctor had resulted in a clean bill of
health.
