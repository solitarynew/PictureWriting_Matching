"One box of love letters for just ONE dollar! Grab one
for yourself immediately while stocks last!" shouted a
stallholder in the main hall of Ever Breeze shopping mall. A
large crowd had already gathered in front of him and more
people were swarming towards him.
It was the Lunar New Year season. Everyone was
busy shopping at the eleventh hour as the stalls would soon
be closed for the festival. The 'must-buy' merchandise
among shoppers were 'love letters', mandarin oranges and
pineapple tarts. Hundreds of shoppers gathered at the
shopping mall and one could see that most would purchase
up to ten or more boxes of these items. Even toddlers
helped to carry bags with their favourite goodies.
The entire shopping mall was alive with the hustle
and bustle of a little city as people weaved their way
through the narrow passageways. At the love letters stall,
people were struggling to get the seller's attention. A man in
the second row with sweat dripping profusely down the
sides of his face, raised a finger in the air to get the seller's
attention. Fortunately for him, the seller saw him and
immediately picked up a box of love letters for him.
However, the man had unwittingly pushed another man
who was in front of him. The man was so annoyed that he
leaned backwards and shoved the man with all his might.
Stunned, the man stumbled and almost fell over backwards.
However, nothing seemed to faze him. He was soon
back on his feet and grabbing the box of love letters.
Pressing the money into the seller's hand, the man walked
away, oblivious to how he had irritated the other customer.
After a long day, the mall finally regained its normal
state and order was restored. The place gradually emptied
out as people began to leave. The stallholders also started to
pack up. A few sulked due to their unexpectedly poor
business despite the occasion. Most however, smiled
cheerfully and positively as they themselves made their way
home to prepare for the Lunar New Year.
