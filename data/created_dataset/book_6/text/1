Both my classmates and my parents have nicknamed
me a bookworm I have certainly lived up to this nickname
because I am an avid reader. My enthusiasm for reading has propelled me towards reading all kinds of books and
everything from posters to advertisements.
My favourite past time is going to the library to
borrow more books. Whenever I have the time, I will go to
the nearest library. I spend hours there reading books and searching for the latest titles from different authors. I can often be found at the adults or young peoples section
Some of my peers are still borrowing books from the
childrenÂ’s section but I have graduated to reading more
difficult books because they cover a wider range of topics
and the writing styles are more interesting.
Due to my eagerness to read, I often take whatever
interesting books I see on the shelves. Even if I am already laden with a pile of books, I still continue searching for books. The hours I spend staring at the spines of books on the book shelves always leave me with a neck ache after I leave the library. However, this has never deterred me from scanning almost all the books on most of the shelves on the library.
If I am searching for a particular book, I will find out
the call number of the book from the library computer
system. Then, I will go to the specific shelf to locate the
book. Sometimes the books are not properly arranged and I have to spend a long time searching for the book.

I am such a familiar sight in the library that I know all the librarians and even the security guard there by their first name. Due to my long-standing relation with the library staff, they often reserve some of the new books for me. I therefore have the privilege of being the first one to read the latest titles.
