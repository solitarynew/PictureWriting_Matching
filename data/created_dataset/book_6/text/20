Of all the teachers I have had in my academic years,
the best teacher is Miss Lim. She was my Mathematics and
English teacher when I was in Primary Five and everyone
then shared the same sentiments as me.
She was patient and kind to us although we were
mischievous and weak in our studies. She would gently
encourage us and tell us to be consistent in our work. She
inculcated a learning spirit in us and always challenged us to
better ourselves. Our friends in other classes always looked
into our classrooms with envy whenever Miss Lim was
teaching us. Mundane subjects became interesting.
Once, when I fell ill and missed lessons, she visited
me to cheer me up. She brought me magazines to read and
also the homework that I missed. Knowing that I was weak
in Mathematics, she spent time coaching me once I was able
to sit up in bed. Initially, I thought that it would be boring
having a Mathematics lesson with Miss Lim, but I was wrong.
Mrs Lim was her usual jovial self and she was very
entertaining. She made the lesson as fun as it usually was in
class. I did not even realise that I had spent two hours doing
my work. When the lesson ended, Mrs Lim told me to take a
break and not to worry about any homework I might have
missed until I returned to school. She promised to help me
with my work again when I went back to school the
following week.
During the holidays, Miss Lim would take us on trips
to the zoo or to Sentosa to help us loosen up. She would not
give us excessive amounts of homework to do during the
holidays because she knew we deserved a break. She was
indeed the best teacher and we wished all teachers were
like her.
