Sherry worked as a dance choreographer in a highly
acclaimed dance studio. Her services were well sought after
in the dance industry and she often worked throughout the
night almost every day to think of innovative and ingenious
dance moves.
Last year, Sherry helped the winners of a dance
competition to choreograph their dance steps. After much
discussion, Sherry and the dancers decided on the song for
the competition. It was a fast one with a catchy beat. The
next stage was crucial and the most difficult. It was the most
demanding stage because the steps had to fit the
accompanying music. Being an experienced dancer, Sherry
had a multitude of ideas. However, not all were suitable for
the music. In addition, some of the steps were too complex
for the dancers. It took a long time to finalise the dance
steps. Many changes were made and Sherry consulted the
dancers on the steps they felt should be changed and asked
them for ideas on better dance steps.
The dancers often practised late into the night.
Dressed comfortably in their leotards and the appropriate
shoes, they jumped and swayed to the music. As there were
many people in a group, the dancers also had to coordinate
their dance moves with one another. They had to be
synchronised when they moved and this was especially
difficult when the dance steps were complicated.
As Sherry had successfully choreographed the dance
steps of the winning group, many other dance groups turned
to her for help. She also made a name for herself
internationally. Three months later, Sherry received a job
offer to work overseas in an internationally renowned dance
school.
