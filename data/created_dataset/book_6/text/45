I swerved, jumped up and flung my hand in the air.
Then, reaching low, I turned my hand in a circular motion
and gave it a hard shake. "What are you doing?" my father
asked with a bemused look on his face. I just nodded at the
television screen in front of me. Shaking his head, my father
told me that life was very different for him when he was
young. Curious, I stopped playing my game and turned off
the television. I asked my father to tell me more about what
his life was like in the past.
Having fun was a simple affair during my father's
childhood as there were many friends to play with.
Traditional games were very different from the games today.
Instead of electronic or board games, the children of
yesteryears would play with marbles, stones and spiders.
My father revealed how they would go deep into the
vegetation to catch strong and huge fighting spiders. There
were also occasions when they would form a large circle
with all the children in the village playing the 'handkerchief
game'. Sometimes, they pitted their skills against one
another by using marbles or stones to hit targets. These
games kept them occupied for hours and even though they
played the same games over and over again, they were not
tired of playing them.
My father also told me stories of how he and his
friends went fishing for guppies in the drains. I was
astounded as I thought that fish could be easily bought from
the pet store. My father roared with laughter when I told
him what I thought. "We were such experts back then that
we could use our bare hands."
After listening to the stories, I wished that I could do
the same. I wondered if my friends would go searching for
drains with guppies in them or search the bushes for spiders.
