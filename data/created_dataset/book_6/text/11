I giggled as I flipped through the Japanese comic. My
sister looked at me enviously, wishing that she could
understand what I was reading. Chuckling, I told her that
Japanese was not as difficult as it looked.
During my vacation, my mother enrolled me in a
Japanese class so that I could learn to speak a new foreign
language. I protested vehemently at first because I was not
interested in learning another language. However, since she
could not get a refund, I had to drag myself to the class.
Little did I know that I would enjoy the lessons.
During the first lesson, we were given a brief introduction to the language by watching a video of the
previous students enjoying themselves learning the
language. We saw how much fun they had and this really
enthused me. After the video presentation, we started with
the lesson proper. The teacher was very patient and
understanding. She was always ready to answer our queries
both within and outside our text.
The lessons consisted of both written and oral
activities. The teacher taught us the new words by writing
them on the board and encouraging us to repeat the words
after her. Initially, most of us were hesitant about
pronouncing the words because we were afraid of
pronouncing them wrongly. We also thought that the
language sounded very strange. However, after much
coaxing, the teacher managed to get us to practise speaking
Japanese. After a while, we became more proficient in the
language.

Although it was tough learning a new language, I
tried my best to understand the different terms and to get
the pronunciations correct. I would finish my homework
diligently and read up on the next topic, so that I could keep
up with the lesson.
After attending the lessons three times a week for a
month, I was able to converse in simple Japanese and read
and write Hiragana and Katakana. I also conversed with my
classmates in Japanese so that we could practise the
language. I was looking forward to taking a more advanced
level of the course.
