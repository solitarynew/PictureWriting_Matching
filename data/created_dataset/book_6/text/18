I wiped my brow and stared hard at the small sheet
of white paper in front of me willing the numbers on the
paper to change. Blinking several times and rubbing my
hands over the small computer generated numbers, I
realised that the numbers were not going to change. I
sighed. My substandard results would surely put me in the
last class next year. I was so shattered that I broke down and
ran out of the class sobbing.
Although I did not put in much effort to study hard
for my examinations, I did not expect to do so badly. I
thought that I could just scrape through all the subjects with
the minimum required to pass. It came as a shock to me that
not only was I unable to meet the minimum requirements, I
failed most of my subjects very badly. Even my strongest
subject received only a passing mark. All these made me
realise how slack I had been. I was devastated and I felt as
though my whole life was ruined.
When I reached home that day, I broke the bad news
to my parents. Seeing how upset I was, my parents did not
scold me. Instead, they consoled me and told me that it was
not the end of the world. They told me not to be upset, but
to try harder to do better next year. Relieved that they did
not reprimand me, I told them that I would put in more
effort to study next year.
That night, I came up with a timetable for my
holidays. I would put in at least three hours of studying
every day. This way, I would be prepared for the new term
when it started. I was determined not to obtain such bad
results again.
