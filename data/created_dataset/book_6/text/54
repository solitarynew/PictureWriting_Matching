Nepal-A plane crashed into the Himalayan Mountains at
approximately 8.15 pm local time yesterday. Flight 999 of
Indian Airlines was travelling from New Delhi to Kathmandu
when the pilot reported that he was experiencing engine
trouble. The plane subsequently disappeared from the radar
screens and was only found by Nepalese army helicopters at
2 am local time today.
Flight 999 was carrying 185 passengers and 16
crewmembers. It was a Boeing 737 that had only recently
undergone a complete engine overhaul. Causes of the crash
are still unclear as rescue efforts are still under way.
The crash site, which is located in the deserted Armadas
mountain range is highly inaccessible and can only be
reached by air. Rescue efforts are also hampered by storms
in the area which is preventing heavy equipment from being
transported to the crash site.
A spokesperson from Indian Airlines has issued a statement
expressing regret for the accident and has assured all
relatives that every effort will be made to rescue any
survivors. It is still unknown as to whether there are any
survivors from the air crash. Relatives of the passengers and
crew can call the special hotline at 456-214-3400 for up-todate
information regarding the rescue effort.
