Whoosh! Whoosh! Bang! A young boy had just
walked into the clinic. In his hands, he held toy soldiers. He
pretended they were fighting. Jolin, who was sitting in the
doctor's waiting room, noticed the boy right away because
of the patch over his right eye. She marvelled at how
unaffected he seemed to be by the loss of an eye and
watched as he followed his mother to a chair nearby.
The doctor's office was very busy that day, so Jolin
had an opportunity to chat with the boy while he played
with his soldiers. She asked him what had happened to his
eye. "There's nothing wrong with my eye. I'm a pirate!"
came his cheeky reply. Then he returned to his game. Jolie
had always felt like an invalid because of her shortened leg
due to a car accident two years ago. However, from that
moment, the word 'pirate' changed her life.
She leaned back against her chair and thought about
what the boy had said. Almost instantly she was transported
to the centre of the ocean onboard a rocky boat. She saw
herself dressed as Long John Silver with her crew around
her. She stood with her legs wide apart-one pegged. Her
hands were clenched at her hips, her head up and her
shoulders back, as she smiled. A gale whipped her coat and
hair. Cold spray blew across the deck as great waves
splashed against the ship. The vessel rocked under the
storm's force. Still she stood firmly, undaunted.
Jolin smiled. She was feeling much better and less
sorry for herself. She whispered, "There's nothing wrong
with my leg. I'm a pirate too." Her encounter with the young
boy had certainly made her more optimistic about life.

Jolin returned home that day with a spring in her step. She was not feeling as miserable as she used to be.
