I could hardly wait for the arrival of my cousin from America. We hardly saw each other but we kept in touch by
sending emails regularly. She was a year older than I was,
but we had the same interests. We both enjoyed swimming
and writing stories and poems. Feeling inspired, I decided to
write her a poem to tell her how I felt about her visit.

Initially, I contemplated using some poetry books to 
get ideas. However, there were so many different types of
poems which talked about such a wide range of topics that
eventually, I decided to pen the poem myself.

I loved playing around with words that rhymed because there was a rhythm to the words when they were
recited together. It was like putting music notes together to
compose a melody. It took a while for me to get my rusty
brain started. However, once I started, I could not stop. The
words came easily to me. I was so immersed in my writing
that I did not even notice that my younger sister was sitting
beside me. She was intrigued to see how easily I could write
a poem and how I was able to express myself using so few
words. I ended up writing more than one poem. When I
finally looked up, I jumped in fright to see my sister sitting
right next to me. She giggled and told me that three hours
had already gone by.

I showed my sister the poems and she had nothing
but praises for what I had written. Together, we selected
one of the poems that I had written. I decided to type it on a
piece of coloured paper. I decorated the edges and placed it
in an envelope. I could not wait to present it to my cousin
when she arrived the following week.

That night, I sent an email to my cousin, asking her for more details about her flight. I also told her about the poem that I had written for her. I hugged myself with excitement. I could not wait for her. arrival.
