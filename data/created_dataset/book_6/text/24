There are about forty pupils in my class. As mine is a
mixed school, there are both boys and girls in my class. In
general the boys in my school are rowdier than the girls.
Those in my class are mischievous and boisterous. The girls,
on the other hand, are more industrious and composed. My
form teacher is Mrs Tan and she is a kind lady who teaches
us Science and English.
My buddies in class are Bryan and Joe. They not only
sit near me in class, but they live in the same block as me
too. We would take the same school bus to school every
morning and eat our favourite food in the canteen together
during recess. Our classmates call us 'The Three Musketeers'
and we are proud of this nickname. Every recess, I take the
opportunity to tell Bryan and Joe hilarious jokes. I never fail
to crack them up. We also chat about our other classmates
and our favourite basketball stars. Sometimes, we are so
absorbed in our conversation that our food would get cold.
Once, the bell rang to signal the end of recess and we had to
gobble down our food before rushing to class.
Once, Joe fell ill and could not attend classes for a
week. Bryan and I, together with our classmates, visited him
every day after school and updated him on our lessons.
Bryan and I even volunteered to coach him on the lessons
he missed because a test was just around the corner. The
three of us often topped the class for tests and examinations
because we studied together and always worked as a team.
Without my classmates, school life would be dull. It is
my classmates whom I look forward to meeting every day
and having engaging conversations with. It is also my
classmates who never fail to lift my spirits when I am having
a particularly bad day. I cannot imagine life without them.
