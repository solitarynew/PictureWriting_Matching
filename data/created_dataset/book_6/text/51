During the last December holidays, we took a trip to
Malacca to visit some friends and relatives for Christmas. We
set off on a showery morning to beat the jam at the
causeway.
When we arrived at Malacca, a torrential rain had
started. The roads were wet and there were visible puddles
of water everywhere. Many of the pedestrians who wore
long pants had folded them up to prevent them from getting
wet but to no avail. Even those with umbrellas and raincoats
were drenched because of the downpour.
As the rain continued, residents started scooping
buckets of water and pouring them out but it was futile. No
matter what they did, water kept flowing into their homes.
Soon, entire front yards were knee deep in water and water
seeped into the homes. Those with cars stuck along the
roads had to push them in the pouring rain. They were
drenched and the cars barely moved an inch and many soon
gave up.
The weather stayed gloomy and wet for the next few
days. By the third day, the city was visibly flooded with
water and the fields in the rural area became lakes. We
could not drive around in town as we were busy helping our
relatives drain as much water from their houses as possible.
However our efforts were fruitless. We heard that many
states and cities around Malaysia were suffering from the
same disaster. Meteorologists attributed the flood to freak
monsoon storms. Fortunately, the water receded and things
became better after a while.
Our trip was a disaster due to the flood. Our plans
did not materialise and we set off for home once the floods
subsided. It was a lousy holiday but the flood opened my
eyes to the tragedy that it could cause. For those whose
homes were destroyed in the flood, I felt sorry for them for
it would be a long time before they could rebuild their
houses.
