My parents have a unique hobby. Unlike other ~~~
parents who spend their free time reading or gardening, my
parents like to dance. They enrolled for dance lessons in the 
community centre two years ago and since then, dancing
has been part of their daily routine.
They attend social dance lessons which teach dances
like Latin, Rock 'n' Roll and Cha Cha conducted by the Dance
Club at the community centre. Regardless of their busy
schedule, they would spend their time in the dance studio
every night. To avoid neglecting my brother and I, they
would bring us along during the weekends to join them in
their hobby. Initially, it was boring to see them dance with
other older people, but as time went by, we found it
interesting and fun to watch them dance with so much poise
and pride. We all agree that their love for dancing has also
deepened their love for each other. Seeing my mother twist
and turn effortlessly is also a surprise as we both have
always thought that she is old and feeble.
Recently, my parents took part in a Social Dance
competition. Their hard work and long hours of practice paid
off when they won the championship title. They were clear
winners as they stood out from the rest of the participants.
Their fluid dance movements and exciting dance moves
impressed the judges. The audience gave them a standing
ovation for they defied the usual characteristics of dancers.
Most dancers were young and many were not married with
two children. The judges even gave them an extra award for
attempting difficult stunts.
Up till today, I still cannot believe that my parents are
the National Social Dance champions. They have even quit
their jobs to start their own dance studio. This is a rare case
of a hobby turning into a career.
