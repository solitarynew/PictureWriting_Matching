Wendy was looking forward to the year-end
celebration. It was to commemorate all the employees who
had made more than a hundred thousand dollars for the
company. After years of hard work, Wendy finally managed
to make the grade.
The party started quietly without the usual
hullabaloo that accompanied office parties. However, for
Wendy, the most exciting moment was the award
presentation ceremony. Those who managed to secure as
much profits for the company as Wendy did, would be given
tokens of appreciation and a plaque by the company
director. For Wendy, it was not the gifts that she was
concerned about. Rather, she liked the thrill of going on
stage to receive her award.
The ceremony started towards the end of the dinner.
There was laughter and congratulations all around as
everyone already knew the people who would be receiving
awards. Wendy waited eagerly for her name to be called.
There was resounding applause when she went on stage.
Everyone's eyes were on her. The director praised her
because she was the youngest recipient of the award. He
went on to say that Wendy was a role model for the other
colleagues to follow. Wendy glowed with pride. She bowed
in front of everyone and waved the hexagonal translucent
plaque excitedly.
Wendy was asked to give a speech before she left the
stage. Blushing, she thanked the director for giving her the
opportunity to work in the company. She also said that she
enjoyed working in the company as it was fast paced and
exciting. There was never a dull moment and there was
always something new to learn.
Wendy was so excited about receiving her award
that she could hardly finish her dinner. For the rest of the
night, she could not keep her eyes off her award. She was
bursting with happiness. She could not wait to show her
family the award when she went home.
