Jennifer Lopaz Heng is a young, capable and
sophisticated woman who came to Singapore about three
years ago. I first met her during a computer exhibition. She
was so fascinated by my deep violet glossy exterior, my high
resolution screen and my high speed processor that she
decided to take me home that very day. It was love at first
sight!
Every morning, I greet her with my widest smile
which is of course the startup screen of a bed of sunflowers
that she has installed in me. She accesses her electronic
mails while she enjoys her breakfast. After that I am gingerly
placed into a black velvet pouch which she grasps in her
hand as she makes her way to the office. On the way,
passers-by always catch a glimpse of this woman and her
velvet pouch-which I live in.
She treats me very well and ensures that I am fully
charged so that I do not become feeble. She takes me
wherever she goes, be it on an overseas business trip,
meeting a local client, having a luncheon with an associate
and even going for dates with her suitors. Once, a hamfisted
man accidentally dropped me onto the marble floor
and she gave him a dressing down. He immediately
apologised for his clumsiness. Fortunately, I was still in good
shape.
Nonetheless, as time passes, I am considered a
dinosaur as far as computers are concerned. Though I have
been very user friendly and have been serving my owner
effectively and efficiently, she has decided that I am
becoming quite obsolete by today's standards. Newer,
faster and even more stylish laptops have been invented
which can do a wider variety of tasks. Today, she is visiting a
computer exhibition again. Oh no! I hope I do not end up in
the storeroom.
