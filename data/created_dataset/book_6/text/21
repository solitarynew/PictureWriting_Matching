Ring ... It was the sweetest sound for the whole of this
term. This was the bell signalling the end of the day and the
end of the school term for the year. It was finally the last day
of school.
For the whole day, we did not have any lessons and
we were allowed to bring our favourite toys and games to
school. We had a pleasurable day playing with our friends
and exchanging our trading cards. All these were unheard of
during term time and would immediately be confiscated if
our teachers caught us bringing them to class. However, it
was the last day of school and this was the one day of the
year when our school became a huge recreational area for
the four hundred students.
My usually quiet classroom rang with shouts and
laughter as groups of students played games and chatted.
Some of my classmates were playing card games. Others
were gesticulating to one another at the back of the
classroom. The loud voices in the classroom were like the
roar of waves crashing against the breakwater. Since our
classroom was air-conditioned, the doors and windows were
closed which further amplified the noise. To add to the
noise, a television set had been rolled into the classroom
and my friends and I were engrossed in one of our favourite
cartoons. To counter the noise from the rest of the class, we
turned up the volume on the television set. Our teacher,
Miss Lee, did not say a word about the noise even though
she was usually a stern teacher.
The last day of school was indeed an enjoyable day. It
was a reward to both the teachers and students who had
worked the whole year. Everyone was looking forward to the
well deserved break.
