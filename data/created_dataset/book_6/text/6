Joshua was on his way home from school with his
friend, Ben. Just as they were about to cross the road, a
group of boys began shouting and kicking several empty
cans along the pavement.
Joshua and Ben turned in the direction of the noise.
"These people must be mad," said Joshua.
"Yes, there is definitely something wrong with them,
creating such a din," Ben replied, nodding in agreement.
Unfortunately, one of the boys in the group heard
them. He told the rest of the group and immediately, all four
of them stormed over. They began shouting vulgarities at
Joshua and Ben, accusing them of being busybodies. One of
them picked up a wooden pole from the ground and began
lashing out at them. Joshua and Ben had the shock of their
lives. They ducked to avoid the pole but Joshua was hit on
his arms and Ben was hit on the side of his head. Four boys
surrounded the two and glared at them, challenging them to
a fight. One of them also began tugging at Joshua's
haversack and told him to surrender his belongings or he
would get beaten up. Another boy snatched Ben's watch and
demanded for his wallet.
When the two boys tried to defend themselves, they
found themselves overpowered by the four. The scene
turned ugly when another boy took out a knife and stabbed
Joshua in the stomach. By the time the police arrived,
Joshua's life was hanging by a thread. The ambulance soon
arrived and Joshua was whisked to the hospital.
As Ben left the police station that afternoon after
making a report, he wished he and Joshua never said
anything about the boys. Those few words had resulted in a
great tragedy.
