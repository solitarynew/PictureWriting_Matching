A blast of cold air greeted Annie as she entered the
family care centre. She was a volunteer there. Her job was to
counsel wayward teenagers and those with family and
relationship problems. Annie headed towards an office at
the back of the centre where she would be told her duties
for that day.
Annie glanced at the paper in her hand. It was the
same family she had spoken to a week ago. It was a family of
three. The parents had neglected their child, leaving the
responsibility of his upbringing to a maid. As a teenager, the
child was now in a gang. The gang members taught him to
smoke and drink excessively. To make up for the lack of time
spent with him, the parents had given him more money than
they should and the child could buy cigarettes for himself
and his friends and splurge on food and luxuries.
The parents and their child were waiting in a room for Annie. She entered the room with a bright smile. She was
determined not to let them argue like they did in the last
counselling session. The father had jumped up from his seat,
calling his son names like 'stupid' and 'useless'. The mother
had joined in by telling him that he was very ungrateful for
all the things that he had. The boy stood up and stared at
them defiantly. He glared at them, refusing to say a word.
Annie tried her best to mediate once again but
before long, the parents started scolding their child, they
ignored everyone else and everything around them. Unable
to tolerate the parents' behaviour any longer, Annie raised
her voice and told them to keep quiet. Stunned, they stared
at her in shock. "How dare you yell at us!" the father
growled. Then, he stormed off. The mother hurriedly
grabbed her handbag before pushing the boy out of the
room after the father.
Annie stared after them helplessly. There was
nothing she could do now. This was not the first time they
walked out of a counselling session. She hoped that one day
they would see the light.
