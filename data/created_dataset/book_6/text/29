Billy's first encounter with a computer was when he
was six years old. His parents bought a computer for his
brother. After seeing how fervent and interested he was in
learning how to operate the computer, they decided to enrol
him in a computer course.
Ever since then, Billy had dreamt of becoming a guru
in the computer field. His first step in realising his ambition
was when he was elected as the President of his college's
computer club. He had the opportunity to work as an intern
in a famous computer firm in the United States during the
holidays. He was amazed at how the employees at the firm
were enjoying their work as computer specialists dealing
with all sorts of computer software and hardware despite
the long hours. They were able to fix all sorts of computer-related
problems and create new websites for their clients.
Moreover, they would be the first to try out any new
computer products.
After the internship, Billy was even more inspired
to do really well for his studies so that he could
become a computer specialist. In the university, he did a
degree programme in Computer Studies and passed his
examinations with flying colours. After graduating, he finally
realised his life-long ambition when the same computer firm
he did his internship with employed him. Within two years,
he was known as the most high-flying computer specialist in
the country.
Every morning, as Billy makes his way to work, he
cannot help but remember how eventful his life has been.
He has been able to realise his dream without having to
endure the trials and tribulations that many of his peers
have had to go through.
