I stood at the door of the plane. Pressing my arms to
my side, raising my head in the air and mumbling a short
prayer, I took a deep breath and leapt out of the plane.
Among all the sporting activities I enjoy, my favourite is still
skydiving. It is regarded as an extreme sport because it is
extremely dangerous and a certain amount of training is
required. This is a sport that requires great mettle and
fitness.
When I first took up this sport, I felt a little 
apprehensive. I was afraid of heights and I could not imagine
leaping out of a plane thousands of feet above ground. With
my brother's encouragement, I signed up for the course with
him. Even during the course, I was not convinced of the
safety measures that the instructors told us about. I
constantly questioned them about the repercussions of a
malfunctioned parachute. Everyone just told me not to
worry. That did not calm my fears.
By the time it was the day of our first jump, we had
already gone through several simulated exercises. We knew
the safety rules and regulations at the back of our hands.
We were all nervous but excited at the same time. My palms
were constantly sweaty and I had to keep wiping them on
my pant legs. When the plane reached an altitude of ten thousand
feet, we stood by the door, ready to take the
plunge. At the word 'go', I leapt out of the plane. It was the
most exhilarating one-minute of my life. Everything became
still and quiet and I glided down to earth at an amazing
speed. When my parachute opened, I heaved a sigh of relief.
After a soft landing, my brother and I gave a loud
scream of victory. I could not believe that I could have been
frightened about taking the dive.
My brother and I decided that we should do this as
often as we could. I am pleased to say that I can now be
considered an expert in this sport.
