The Chinese ethnic group celebrates many festivals
throughout the year, like the Hungry Ghosts Festival, MidAutumn
Festival and Dragon Boat Festival. Of the many
festivals, the most important one widely celebrated by most
Chinese all over the world is Chinese New Year.
Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year, is
celebrated at the beginning of the new moon. The ancient
Chinese coincided this festival with the coming of spring to
celebrate the bountiful harvest of the previous year. It is an
auspicious day for everyone and cheerful greetings are
exchanged to bring in good luck and fortune. It is also a time
for relatives and friends to visit one another, bringing good
tidings and wishes for guests and hosts alike.
Chinese New Year is also a time for feasting. Various
kinds of goodies and sweets are offered to both children and
adults, as this symbolises good fortune and happiness
ahead. The most lavish feast during the New Year season is
the reunion dinner on the eve of New Year. This is a time for
the whole family to gather at the dinner table and enjoy a
scrumptious dinner to herald in the New Year.
It is truly a wonderful season of celebration for the
Chinese, so much so that it lasts for fifteen days. This is one
of the longest and grandest celebrations of all the festivals. I
look forward to this festival every year as it is always a time
for great merriment.
