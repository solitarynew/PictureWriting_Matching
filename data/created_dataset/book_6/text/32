"Come on, Mark!" I shouted as we ran up the stairs
to the music room. "We are going to be late for practice
again!" We were on our way for band practice as we were
participating in our school's fiftieth anniversary celebrations.
Mark and I were pleased that we had been selected among
the many band members to take part in the performance.
We practised round the clock for most of the
December school holidays. Some of us even camped
overnight in school. We made many errors and on several
days, my clarinet seemed to make a honking sound no
matter what I did.
On the day of the concert, we arrived early at the
Esplanade Concert Hall. While waiting backstage with my
friends, we played card games and listened to our MP3
players to sooth our nerves and forget about our anxiety. I
became panicky when it was the band's turn to perform.
However, once I held my clarinet, my nervousness subsided.
When the conductor gave the signal, the familiar soothing
melody reverberated throughout the hall. The deep sound
of the bass guitar, the smooth light sound of my clarinet and
the rhythmic beating of the drum brought loud applause
from the audience. Our conductor waved his baton in the
air. Sometimes, he made wide gentle movements and at
other times, he made quick jerky movements to tell us to
pick up the pace.
The performance was a success. We were exultant.
We even received a standing ovation. It was indeed a
memorable jubilee celebration.
As Mark and I went home that day, we could not stop
talking about the concert. It was Mark's second performance
and my first. Although it seemed like a frightening
experience, it turned out well in the end. I had enjoyed
myself thoroughly. I wondered if there would be any other
performances in the future.
