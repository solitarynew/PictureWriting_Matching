I turned the corner and leapt over a low fence. Then I
squeezed through several bushes and hopped over a narrow
drain. Turning the corner, I dashed up a gentle ramp and
sped towards the lifts at a void deck a short distance ahead. I
was panting and perspiring, but I was very eager to get
home. I could not wait to tell my mother the results on my
English test. English was one of the few subjects that I found
easy to score a distinction for in every test and examination.
I knew that I had performed so well in English
because of my love for reading. Coming from a well-to-do
family, I had the privilege of getting whatever books I
wanted. I not only bought whatever books I wanted from
the bookstores, my parents also allowed me to order books
over the Internet.
Writing came naturally to me after all the reading
that I did. I never had any problems with writing because I
was exposed to a variety of words and writing styles from
my extensive reading. Once, I participated in a creative
writing competition and won the first prize. The win helped
to boost my confidence and I was spurred on to write even
more stories. I was also encouraged to read more books so
as to brush up my writing skills.
As a result of being fluent in English, I did not have to
try hard to do well in tests and examinations. Much to the
envy of my other classmates, essential English rules came
easily to me because I often spoke English. Due to the
effortless way in which I handled English in school, several of
my classmates asked me to tutor them after school. I agreed
readily because I was keen to share my knowledge with
them.
I knew that pride would come before a fall, so even
though I excelled in this subject, I knew that I could not be
complacent. There were endless types of books to read and
there was always something new to learn every day. I would
continue to strive for even better knowledge of the subject.
