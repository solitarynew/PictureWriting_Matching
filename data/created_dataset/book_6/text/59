John took the small cream coloured cardboard box
out from under his bed. Lifting the lid, he carefully took out a
yellowish paper. It contained lyrics to a song that he had
written himself. He finally found it at the bottom of a stack
of old letters. He took out the paper and retrieved his guitar
from behind a door. Then he settled down on his bed.
He began strumming his guitar to warm up. Then, he
started humming the tune of the song. After a while, the
familiar chords started coming back to him and he was able
to strum and sing along. It was a slow song and there were
parts where the melody did not seem to fit the lyrics.
However, it was a very special song to John. He wrote it for
his mother when she was still alive.
The song told of how his mother strove to provide for
the family after his father was sent to prison. During a time
when most people looked down on women and
discriminated against them in the workplace, his mother
was still successful in putting food on the table for John and
his two sisters. The odds were against her but her
determination pulled her through.
Tears streamed down his face as he sang the song.
The lyrics began to blur and his tears smudged the ink on the
paper. However, John kept on singing. Despite his sadness,
he sang with gusto, as he knew his mother would have
wanted him to. In fact, he had sung the song so many times
before that he actually knew the lyrics by heart but he still
wanted to look at them, just to be sure that he did not get
them wrong.
It was indeed a heartrending sight. It was the special
song he had shared with his mother and it was certainly apt
to sing it on Mother's Day. When John reached the end of
the song, he took a deep breath before singing it again. He
could not help thinking of his mother and how she always
smiled and ruffled his hair whenever he had sung her the
song.
