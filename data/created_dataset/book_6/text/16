Failure is the mother of all success. Jake had often
heard this Chinese proverb from his mother. She told him
this every time he lost a race. Having heard it countless of
times, it was now ingrained in his mind.
However, a year ago, Jake began to lose hope. He
had just taken part in another race and again he had come in
last. He had never felt so defeated in his life. He wondered if
he should simply give up running and concentrate on his
studies instead. However, a voice inside his head told him
that he should persevere and try one more time.
It was the annual school sport's meet. Jake
represented the Purple House. However, he knew that not
many people were rooting for him. His popularity as a
runner had diminished together with his faith in himself and
his enthusiasm for the sport. Just before the start of the
race, all the participants lined up in a row at the starting line.
Everyone looked expectantly ahead of them as they geared
themselves up for the race. When the whistle blew,
everyone sprinted as fast as they could.
Initially, Jake was trailing a long way behind the rest
of the participants. He wondered if it was his imagination or
if he really heard the crowd booing him. He willed himself
to ignore the spectators and ran forward, feeling more
determined as he went. Just before the halfway mark, he
managed to outrun three of the other participants. He was
amazed at how fast he was going. His confidence soared and
he ran like the wind. He was so fast that he surprised even
himself.
Jake came in second in the race. All the training had
indeed been useful. He waved to the crowd as they cheered
and clapped loudly. He had never felt so proud in his life.
Jake was surprised when people he did not know
came up to speak to him after the race. He beamed with
pride when they praised him. Jake could not wait to start
training again for the next race.
