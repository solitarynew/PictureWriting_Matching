I have never been academically inclined. I had to put
in a lot of effort in order to perform well in school. This was
indeed stressful and pressurising for me. However, I am very
grateful to one of my Primary school teachers. Not only did
she teach me the fundamentals of Mathematics and
Science, she also taught me how to handle stress and to
cope with my studies.
Mrs Toh only taught my class halfway through my
final year in Primary school. Initially she was very strict with
us, demanding that we completed all our work neatly and
hand them in on time. However, I soon discovered that she
was also a very dedicated and caring teacher. When she
found out that I was weak in Mathematics, she stayed back
after school almost every day to coach me in my work. I
would spend an hour in the staff room listening to her
explain the concepts and formulas to me.
Besides teaching me, she often had words of
encouragement for me as well. She would ask me about my
family and how I was doing in the other subjects. She also
wanted to know more about me. She would ask me about
my hobbies and my likes and dislikes. When she found out
that I had a sweet tooth, she bought me sweets and
chocolates whenever she could. She told me that I should
concentrate on improving my knowledge and understanding
of the subjects. I should not be comparing my marks with my
other classmates or feeling dejected when I did not perform
as well as they did. Even though she was old, Mrs Toh was
very athletic and she often encouraged me to continue
playing sports so that I would be able to unwind after a
stressful day at school.
With Mrs Toh's help, I finally managed to score well
in my final examinations and enter a good Secondary school.
On the day of the results, Mrs Toh was more elated than I
was to find out how good my results were.
Today, have just secured my first job.
Unfortunately, I would not be able to share it with her
because she passed away three years ago.
