John leads a hectic and busy lifestyle. He is always in
the office working sixteen hours a day, leaving him very little
time for himself or to pursue any leisure activities. He is
often stressed due to his heavy work commitments, but he
manages to keep his sanity by listening to music. This could
be blaring heavy metal songs or soft soothing tunes.
John believes that music is his only escape from the
harsh realities of life. When he is not busy, he would be at
his favourite music store buying the latest music
compilations on compact discs. The thumping music can be
heard from across the road and is ear shattering in the store.
However, John does not mind. He does a jingle to the music
whenever he hears it. John frequents the music stores so
often that he knows the staff there. They will keep copies of
the latest discs for him as they know he will go to the shop
regularly. Once John walks into the store, the staff will greet
him by name and introduce him to the latest discs. Although
John visits the store at least once a fortnight, he still leaves
the place laden with a bag of discs. When John has the time,
he will listen to some of the discs in the store before buying
them. However, he is often too busy and will simply trust
whatever the staff recommends.
Sometimes, John will buy songs online from the
Internet. He enjoys listening to all kinds of music, but prefers
rock and new age music. This is because such music gives
him inspiration for yet another stress-reliever hobby composing
music.
Music helps to calm John down and to think
rationally and clearly. He also claims that the music he
writes helps him to vent his frustration and anger. This
explains the fast tempo and beat for many of his music
scores.
