Feeling bored, Jeffrey decided to read one of his old
storybooks. He took it down from his shelf, wiping away the
dust. The story was a fairytale and although Jeffrey had
stopped reading fairytales, this was still his favourite
because it was the first story he had ever read. He turned
the yellowing pages and looked in delight at the colourful
pictures of knights, dragons and princesses in the pictures.
Suddenly, a puff of smoke rose from the book.
Startled, Jeffrey grabbed the book as he felt it being pulled
by an invisible force from his hands. A sudden gust of wind
blew past him and in the twinkling of an eye, several small
creatures appeared on the book. Jeffrey stared wide-eyed at
the creatures as they began talking to one another. They
appeared oblivious to another being ten times their size
staring at them.
As Jeffrey listened to their conversation, it dawned
on him that they were acting out the story. He could not
believe that this was actually happening. The characters in
his storybook had actually come to life! He tried to get the
attention of the creatures but no one noticed him. He raised
his voice, trying hard to talk to them but to no avail.
Jeffrey was so engrossed in the sight before him, that
his voice had risen to such a crescendo waking his mother
from her afternoon nap. However, as soon as she stepped
into the room, all the creatures disappeared and Jeffrey
appeared like a lunatic because he was screaming at his
book. His mother glared at him, before marching out of the
room.
Jeffrey stared at the book in his hand. He wondered if
he had been dreaming. He rubbed the pages and felt a slight
tingling in his fingers. However, nothing else happened. Did
the characters really come to life?
