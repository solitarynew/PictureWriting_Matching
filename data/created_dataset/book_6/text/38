Hari Raya Puasa is a major celebration for the
Malays. As most of the Malays are Muslims, almost all of
them celebrate this occasion. It is a celebration which occurs
after a month long period of fasting which is required of
them by Islam. Like the Chinese and Indians, it also marks
the start of the New Year based on their calendar, which is
unique to their culture.
During the fasting month of Hari Raya Puasa, there
are many stalls in the night market in Geylang Serai selling
various kinds of goods and food. Many Malays will throng
the market at night in search of bargains and to soak in the
festive spirit. In addition to the night market, shopping
centres and departmental stores also sell items like clothes.
Besides clothes, many also shop for new household items.
Many furniture stores also take the opportunity to have a
massive sale. This benefits not just the Malays, but others as
well.
Families will also be busy preparing different types of goodies as the actual day draws near. The most popular
dishes prepared during this celebration are rice cakes, satay,
and different kinds of cakes and sweets. Pandan leaves are
also often used in decorations to symbolise the festival. The
delicious aroma from the constant cooking wafts through
the air and drifts out of the homes. Many families will also
use running lights to decorate their homes. Multicoloured
bright twinkling lights adorn windows and doors helping to
light up the night.
Some of the Malays will ensure that their new
clothes are of the same colours as their family members.
This is a sign of solidarity among the family members. It is
indeed a wonderful celebration for the Malays because it
allows the family to come together as one.
