Temperate countries experience four seasons-spring,
summer, autumn and winter. Different activities are
carried out during each of these seasons and the weather
changes so drastically that it is obvious that a new season
has arrived.
Spring is a season when life begins after a dreadful
and sleepy cold season. Wild flowers bloom in parks,
creating a bright colourful array of red, pink and yellow
flowers. Birds begin to sing earnestly and animals come out
of hiding as the snow and ice starts to thaw. It is also a
season of hope as life starts anew yet again.
After spring comes summer. This is a time of
enjoyment when the harvest is at its peak. People and
animals alike enjoy the warmth. The days are usually long
and the nights are short. This means that the sun stays in the
sky for a longer time. The usual hustle and bustle, which was
missing during the cold season, begins again.
Things start to slow down with the coming of
autumn. This is when the crops are harvested and the trees
start to shed their leaves. The ground is often blanketed
with different shades of brown leaves. Autumn is also a time
of reflection of the year's happenings and for one to take
stock of one's life. The days get shorter and the air cools
down. It is nature's way of dealing with the onslaught of the
harsh winter days.
Winter blankets the earth with snow and ice. Animals go into hibernation and people don their winter wear. People work less as the days are short and it is time for
many to take a break. Many will also seek warmer climates
while others will just stay indoors by the fireplace.
The four seasons will come and go like clockwork.
With every passing season, time passes and people grow
older. I think it is interesting to be able to experience the
four seasons. Although life might be more difficult during
winter, life would still be fun and interesting.
