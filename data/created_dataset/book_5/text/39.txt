Life is what you make it out to be. Whatever you conceive and believe in, you can achieve. This advice is commonly given by many of our seniors when we face any difficulties and crossroads in our lives. The kinds of life we want depend entirely on us, and we are the ones who bear the consequences for our own actions. My parents want me to focus on my studies now. This will be the only way for me to enjoy the fruits of my labour in the future. My parents have always emphasised the importance of doing well in school. They often tell me that if I study hard, I will be able to become what I want to be in the future. without setting my priorities straight and following them, nothing can turn back the clock to undo my mistakes. I have always imagined myself graduating from the university at the top of my class. I will be so proud of myself and I can just imagine how proud my parents would be as well. I would like to work in a bank in the future. I do not mind starting at a low position and working my way gradually to the top, the way my father did. The kind of life I want depends heavily on my actions today. As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow.' is very true indeed.
