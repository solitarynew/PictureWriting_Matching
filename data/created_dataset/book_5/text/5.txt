My brother has just graduated from the polytechnic with a diploma in optical studies. He has found a job in an optical shop. He works as an optician and his job is to prescribe optical instruments like spectacles and contact lenses. My brother's job is to check the condition of his customers' eyes and to determine the lenses that they need. Even though my brother was taught the ways of checking a person's eyesight when he was in school, there are many other things he has to do now which he was not taught previously. Firstly, he has to ensure that he is polite to the customers. This might be especially difficult when the customer is very demanding. Secondly, my brother also has to help his customers select their spectacle frames. His customers can range from young children to old people. They all want to look their best and they often turn to my brother for his advice. Once, an extremely vain customer came to the shop. After having his eyes checked, he then proceeded to select a pair of frames. The man tried all types of frames from plastic ones to metal ones and even those that were frameless. My brother's colleague, who was helping the man, was beginning to lose his patience. Frames of all shapes and colours were strewn all over the tabletop. Seeing the situation, my brother immediately came over to help. His amiable and patient nature soon won the customer over. The man listened intently as my brother gave his expert advice on the types of frames that were most suitable for him. He willingly took out whatever frames he wanted to try on. It was a mammoth task but my brother managed to help the customer choose a pair of spectacle frame. The customer was extremely pleased and he thanked my brother for his help. My brother enjoys his job very much. He likes to
 meet the different people who come to his shop and he is glad that he can help to correct their vision.
