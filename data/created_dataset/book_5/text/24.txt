Singapore is fundamentally known as the "Clean and Green' city. compared to other cities, the level of air pollution here is relatively lower. However, this does no mean that we can take this clean air for granted. The clean air and beautiful surroundings in Singapore are the results of meticulous planning and control by the government. Unfortunately, citizens of one's own country may not be the cause of air pollution in today's era of globalisation Rather, air pollution has become global in nature. Take for example the yearly forest fires in Indonesia. Singaporeans are badly affected by the polluted air that gets blown from Indonesia to the country despite not having started the fire. There is little that can be done about it as the source of the air pollution is from another country. The haze that clouds Singapore is a serious health hazard for the people. This illustrates clearly the harmful effects of air pollution. When pollution occurs in Singapore, many people succumb to respiratory illnesses because of the large numbers of dust particles. Although wearing masks is not commonly practised in Singapore, it might one day become a necessity for many people. Through this example, various factors can cause air pollution and everybody has a part to play in fighting this problem. Countries must learn to work hand in hand to control air pollution to enable our future generations to have a better quality of life.
