Timothy spent the day at the bird park last Sunday. Having heard a lot about the place, he could not wait to explore what had been termed a paradise for the birds. When Timothy arrived at the bird park, he headed directly to the panorail. It was an air conditioned monorail that took visitors around the bird park, allowing visitors to view the picturesque park from elevated ground. The panorail ride was able to whet Timothy's appetite for a better view of the park on foot. The highlight of his visit was the bird show. Timothy arrived just in time for a series of bird shows. During the bird shows, birds of all shapes and sizes flew around the trainer, landing on specific wooden poles or perching on the trainer's hand. Timothy's favourite was the 'Birds of Prey' how. He stared in awe at the eagles who seemed to appear out of nowhere, swooping down, almost into the audience. Timothy was surprised that birds could be trained to fly at the command of the trainers. The eagles flew at lightning speed in and out of the arena. They also flew in circles above the audience. Timothy counted a total of three different eagles that were used for the bird show. Upon observation. Timothy realised that the trainers wore vests with many pockets so that they could keep food for the birds. The food was given to the eagles when they landed on the places where they were supposed to. Timothy also visited the penguin enclosure. They were adorable in their black and white coats. As Timothy watched, they gathered in groups as though they were chatting. Some of them dived into the water. Their streamlined body impressed Timothy. He wished he could swim as well as them. After walking around the park, Timothy ended his visit to the bird park by having a meal at a restaurant located within the park itself. From the restaurant, he had a breathtaking view of the beautiful park.
