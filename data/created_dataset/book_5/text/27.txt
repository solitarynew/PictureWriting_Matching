"Where is Paul?" asked Miss Lim, trying desperately to ask a question over a crowd of restless boys waiting to be dismissed. She repeated the question as she raised her voice in a futile attempt to beat the increasing hubbub. "You are so stupid! Are you blind?" screamed my classmate, John, in an outburst of anger. He stared at Miss Lim and raised his arms impatiently. "He is over there!" he shouted, pointing to Paul who was in a corner. Miss Lim was dumbfounded by John's audacity. No pupil had ever spoken so rudely to her before. She was so shocked that she did not even reprimand John. "Hey, don't be rude to the teacher!" Gary, the class monitor scolded him severely. "Why are you so rude? Apologise to the teacher now!" Edwin, the prefect, echoed in response to John's disrespect for their rather soft-spoken teacher. Up till today, I cannot forget how audacious John had been. We had been brought up and taught to respect our elders, but John was bold enough to go against this age-old tradition of courtesy and respect. Although John eventually apologised under peer pressure, he did it very reluctantly. He apologised with a snarl and frown and he did not even bother to look the teacher in the eye.
