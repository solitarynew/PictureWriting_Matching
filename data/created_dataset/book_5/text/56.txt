The entire world welcomed the new year with elaborate parties. Singapore was no exception. Many roads in numerous locations were closed for night long parties to celebrate the joyous occasion. Crowds of people flocked to these locations to celebrate the countdown to the new year. Peter celebrated the new year with his friends too. He had a party in his house and he invited all his best friends and neighbours. There was loud music and delicious food at the party. Ten seconds before midnight, everyone at the party counted down together. At the stroke of midnight, Peter and his friends joined revellers everywhere as they sang 'Auld Lang Syne' to bid farewell to the past year. Wearing their party hats, they joined hands and danced around the house wishing everyone a happy new year. The party lasted well into the wee hours of the morning. By the time the last guest left the house, the rays of the sun were already streaming into the house. However, things did not go smoothly everywhere. With the great crowds, conflict arose and at a fight broke out at a popular fast food restaurant. With the long queues, there was a lot of pushing and shoving. A short-tempered man was annoyed when someone behind brushed past him and tried to cut the queue. Already agitated from having to queue for such a long time, the man lashed out at the other man and punched him. Furious, the other man retaliated by punching him in return. A fight broke out which was fortunately put to a stop when the police arrived. Many events took place throughout Singapore as everyone ushered in the new year. Some started off the new year well, while others had a bad start to the new year.
