The blue whale is the biggest mammal on Earth. It lives in the cold depths of the oceans, often elusive to mankind. Despite its massive size, it eats only plankton. This s an irony because it is the biggest creature yet it only consumes microscopic organisms to fill its massive appetite. Due to its size and body characteristics, man has found much use for the blue whale. Many have been killed for their body fat as well as their other parts to make things like soap, wax and food. This has been going on for decades and as technology advances, the techniques and time taken to hunt these whales become more efficient and effective. However, the improved efficiency for man has spelled danger and disaster for the population of blue whales. Its population has declined greatly and studies have shown that the present pattern of whaling will lead to its extinction in years to come. Sustainable harvesting of whales has not been practised by whalers and they refuse to heed the advice of conservationists. However, it is not just whaling that will lead to the extinction of the blue whale. Pollution has also caused many whales to perish. Oil spills and debris have prevented the whales from looking for food, further worsening the situation that the whales are facing. The blue whale faces the threat of extinction if steps are not taken to reduce its killings. It has thus joined the list of many animals under the endangered species category.
