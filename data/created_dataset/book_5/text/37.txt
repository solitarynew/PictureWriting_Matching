Tom was a helpful person. When he was younger, he would often help his classmates with their work. He would also help the teachers to carry their books. When he grew older, Tom transferred his attention to several worthy causes. One of the more prominent things he did was to help out in several old folks' homes. He volunteered his services on weekends and he would spend all his Saturday and Sunday afternoons in the company of the elderly. Although Tom was decades younger than they were, he was able to get along with them. Perhaps it was his ability to speak the different languages and dialects. Perhaps it was his ability to listen attentively and patiently to whatever they said. Many of them looked upon him like a grandson and would often ask him about his life and give him advice. As Tom was a doctor by training, he often put his skills and expertise to use at the homes. He would check the elderly regularly and advise them on how to lead a healthy life. Besides the elderly, Tom also went to children's homes. He thrilled the children there with his tricks and made interesting model aeroplanes for them as well. The children looked forward to his visits and always pestered him to teach them something new. Tom derived great satisfaction and joy from helping people. Last month, Tom was commended by the Council for Social Services for his extraordinary contribution to society. He has been heralded as someone whom the other citizens should emulate.
