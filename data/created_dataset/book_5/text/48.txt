It was nearing the end of the school term. The examinations were over and David had performed extremely well. His parents had promised to take him overseas during the school holidays and had left the decision of choosing a destination to him. David had gone to several travel agencies to get brochures for different tours. He looked at all of them gleefully, wondering which of the countries he should go to Everyone looked interesting and each of them had their own unique places of interest. David looked from one brochure to another, getting more and more excited. Just when he was mulling over whether to go to America, Europe or Japan, his parents returned home. He jumped up and showed them all the brochures that he had collected. He had read them so many times that he could almost memorise what was in each country and the different travel packages that were available. His parents smiled at him, amused by his behaviour. He seemed like a tour guide. They had never seen him so enthusiastic about anything before, David's parents told him to think carefully about where he would like to visit. They promised to bring him to the travel agency to book the tickets once he had made his decision.
