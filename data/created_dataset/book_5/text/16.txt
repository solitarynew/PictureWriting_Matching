Unidentified Flying Objects, commonly known as UFOS, are allegedly flying saucers from space that make periodic visits to Earth. There have been many reports of UFO sightings mostly from people living in the Northern Hemisphere of the globe. However, there has not been any scientific proof or evidence that these UFOs really exist, UFO sightings have indeed generated much interest from the press. There are science fiction stories and films about UFOs and aliens. Such films are very popular. Many tabloids and television programmes have reports and features on UFO sightings. These reports have created much hype, which have led many to believe that UFOs really exist and many have accused governments of covering up actual UFO landing sites and artefacts. In Britain, there was a club set up especially to monitor UFO sightings, which was rampant during the Cold War from the 1960s to the early 1990s. Membership was. open to almost anyone, and not surprisingly, most of the members had spotted UFOs in the sky at one time or another. However, membership began to dwindle and the club was forced to close down because of the lack of UFO sightings and its largely reduced popularity. So have you seen a UFO lately? If you have, the UFO club really needs members like you to keep both the club and the UFO hype alive.
