There have been many reports of juvenile delinquents being charged in court today. It is a cause for concern because these delinquents pose a threat to society Many of them are latchkey children who are often left at home when their parents go out to work. These delinquents commit a variety of crimes. Some of them vandalise walls. They often deface the walls at void decks with their scribbles. There has also been an increase in the number of pickpockets who are juvenile delinquents. Many steal because they want the money to buy branded clothes and shoes. Their own allowances are insufficient to cover the cost of a designer outfit. Many are becoming expert pickpockets and shoplifters. Teenagers who work in groups manage to outsmart the security system and steal whatever they want from the shelves. Even though shoplifting is seen as a serious crime with heavy penalties, these do not seem to deter potential offenders. However, with the help of the public, many of these delinquents are apprehended by the police. When members of the public spot these delinquents committing illegal acts they will not hesitate to call the police. Police officers give talks in school to warn children of the dangers of becoming juvenile delinquents. The children are told of the consequences of committing a crime and are discouraged from being in bad company and being led astray. However, efforts must also be taken by the family to stem out juvenile delinquency. Family members need to spend more time with their children, teaching them the right values. With the right values, these children will probably not commit crimes when they are older. Putting an end to juvenile delinquency is not a simple process. Parents, schools and the public need to work together to ensure that children grow up in a proper and safe environment.
