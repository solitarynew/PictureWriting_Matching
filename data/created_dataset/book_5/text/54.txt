George and Peter discussed what had happened just last week. As police officers, they were glad that all their efforts at trying to catch the imposter had paid off. "1 suspected that it would be someone who looked harmless like a door to door salesman," George said as he shook his head. The salesman was actually an imposter. He would pretend to sell some books and magazines to unsuspecting households while surveying their homes for any valuables. He would take note of where the owners kept their valuables while they went to get their money for the payment of his 'goods'. The 'salesman' would also pretend to knock on doors to avoid arousing the suspicion of neighbours while he loitered around the corridors to take note of the empty houses. The police only realised that he was actually a robber when one of the victims saw him breaking into a house. She recognised him as the 'salesman' who was always in the estate, The police were thus able to solve this major crime and nab the suspect for the spate of robberies happening in the neighbourhood. The salesman tried to make excuses for why he was picking a lock at one of the flats. However, he failed to convince George and Peter who were insistent on taking him back to the police station. After several hours, he finally succumbed and confessed to his misdeeds. Everyone in the neighbourhood was glad that the imposter had finally been apprehended. They felt that their neighbourhood was much safer.
