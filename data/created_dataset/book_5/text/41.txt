"Do you think there are any pirates in this area?" Ling asked warily. "This place seems rather secluded and far away from any port." "Relax, Ling," Rob replied confidently. "It is safe around here. I have been here numerous times and l've never come across any pirates. Even the waters are more peaceful here than in other areas. Anyway, we have a radio to call for help if there is a need to." "I have a hunch that something will happen, though," Ling alleged, still feeling insecure despite Robert's reassuring reply. "There are only the two of us here in this costly looking leisure craft. I am afraid it will attract unnecessary attention." Robert just smiled and ignored Ling's insecurity. He was used to Ling overreacting to situations like this. "Don't do this; what will happen if; how...The list never ends," he thought to himself. Suddenly, they could hear the roar of a speedboat engine cutting through the air in the silent night. Robert quickly stood up to scan the waters with his flashlight, but he could not see anything in the darkness. However, the next moment, his beam of light revealed a man in black firing a warning shot into the air. The couple froze. Dressed in conventional pirate attire of striped black and white shirt and a bandana around the head, his menacing glare caused Robert and Ling to shake with fear. When the couple realised what had happened, it was too late to radio for help. Three pirates emerged from the darkness and climbed onboard the leisure craft. However, as Ling and Robert were compliant and immediately handed over their valuables, the pirates did not harm them. They were gone in minutes and did not even bother to raid the craft. Robert called for help once the pirates were gone and Ling hurriedly manoeuvred the boat back to shore. It had been a close shave. The couple were glad to return home unharmed. However, Robert regretted not informing the coast guard of where they were travelling.
