"Are you sure you don't need a ride home? It's late and there's a full moon tonight. Not afraid of werewolves or vampires jumping on you?" Budi asked in jest. "Although we just finished watching a horror movie, I'm not scared of those silly things. It's just a stupid movie and it's not real. It's only a ten-minute walk home. See you tomorrow," Jake replied. Suit yourself, and watch out for the werewolves.." Budi chuckled as he sped away on his motorcycle. The path leading to Jake's house was unusually quiet that night. A light breeze was blowing and there was a gentle rustling sound. Jake was walking along a quiet path deep in thought about the movie and Budi's threat. "Do werewolves and vampires really exist?" Jake thought aloud. "What if they do..." A loud roar rudely interrupted his train of thoughts, A beastly looking creature with overgrown brown hair suddenly appeared in front of him. Jake got the shock of his life when the creature, with a man's body and a wolf's head started snarling at him, showing its long, sharp fangs. Jake froze in his tracks and screamed, "Arrgh...Werewolves!" The next moment, he felt someone shaking him vigorously and calling out his name. "Jake! wake up. You are having a nightmare!" his brother bawled. "You almost woke p the entire neighbourhood with your screams. Don't watch horror movies if you've no nerve." All Jake could do was smile faintly. Then, he got a drink of water before trying to go back to sleep. He tossed and turned for a while before eventually falling into a deep sleep once again. He vowed never to watch a horror show late at night again.
