Many things can be done today that nobody would have dreamt of a hundred years ago. Life is more interesting and complicated now and nothing is impossible. As technology advances, even more things become possible. In fact, travelling beyond earth might be something that everyone can do. A hundred years from now, there will probably be even more improvements as man's curiosity causes him to explore things that were previously impossible. Travelling on a spaceship might be as common as taking a bus or a train Roads might not exist because everyone would be flying. This might reduce traffic congestion because of the immense expanse of the sky. Even cars would be flying ano people can travel faster from one place to another. Landing on the moon would be commonplace and it would be safe and cheap for anyone to do that. Robots would become an important part of the human race. They would no longer just be used for work, but can even become friends. They can be a companion to children, entertaining them in much better ways than anyone else can. Since they will not be tired, they will also be able to keep up with these children. No one would be bored with a robot as a friend. Skyscrapers would no longer just be restricted to earth. There could be skyscrapers on other planets as well With the improvements in technology, buildings could be in all shapes and sizes with some even suspended in midair. The possibilities are endless. With the many ground breaking inventions today, it will not be surprising if such changes occur in the future What is fiction today might eventually become a reality.
