Joslina lived in a town that was always filled with litter. Everywhere he walked, he was surrounded by litter. There was litter on the ground, litter on the benches and even litter falling from blocks of flats. There was a park outside Joslina's block of flats. Initially it was a popular place among many residents. The greenery was a refreshing change from the city most people worked in. However, after a while, people began littering in the park. There was litter all over the place. The people enjoyed having picnics there, but did not bother clearing up after the picnic. Styrofoam boxes empty drink bottles and tissue paper were strewn everywhere. It was impossible to even sit on the grass. Once, Joslina saw a boy throwing a banana skin on the floor. No one bothered to use the dustbins in the park. Appalled by the sight, Joslina was tempted to pick up all the litter that he saw. However, he knew that someone else would litter and dirty the park again. Just as he was about to pick up the litter, he saw an apple core "flying down' from one of the houses in the block of flats. Joslina knew where it came from. It was thrown by old Mr Tee, Joslina's neighbour. Joslina shook his head in disgust. He wished Mr Tee would stop throwing things out of his flat. Joslina wished the people around him would be more considerate, This way, more people would be able to enjoy the amenities. He decided to write to the town council, telling them about the atrocities of the neighbourhood. He hoped that something could be done.
