Mr Toh rushed home to tell his wife the good news. He had just received an invitation in the mail to attend his secondary school reunion dinner. Mr Toh had not seen many of his old classmates for many years. It had been almost twenty years since he left school. After they graduated from school, all of them had gone their separate ways. It was already difficult to keep in touch with those in the same country, what's more those who had gone overseas. Many of Mr Toh's friends had ambitions to be lawyers and doctors. Mr Toh wondered if they had fulfilled their goals. Mr Toh told his wife about a group of boys that he used to play with during his school days. They would often play tricks on the students and even their teachers. Although their tricks were harmless, the irate teachers often punished them in an effort to deter them from playing even more tricks. Mrs Toh listened in amusement to the stories her husband was telling her. Mrs Toh glanced at the letter for the reunion dinner. She was glad that the old boys of the school were allowed to bring partners. She would have a chance to find out what her husband's friends were like. She could not wait to meet his old classmates as well.
