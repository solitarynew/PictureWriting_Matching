Yilok, my god-sister, is unlike the conventional woman in society. Many who have met her would always be n awe of her courage and spirit. Due to her unique traits, he wields considerable influence over those around her. Yilok is the manager of an advertising company. As the manager, she leads a team of employees who respect and admire her for her continued determination to succeed. She constantly encourages her employees to work hard and to strive for the best. There is another side of Yilok that is very different from the life that she leads in the office. Instead of wearing office suits and working in an air-conditioned environment, Yilok dons sports gear and is the leader of an expedition team that has participated in the gruelling Eco-Challenge Competition which is held biannually. It is a strenuous competition where participants compete against one another in a team that takes them across rigorous environments. Her valour and positive attitude has won the respect and admiration of her teammates and competitors. Although her team did not win the championship, she was awarded the best participant by the judges who were impressed by her bravery and spirit in times of difficulties. She is truly an inspiration to others. Up till today, she is the most capable lady I have ever met. I draw my source of inspiration from her whenever I feel like giving up on things I deem unmanageable.
