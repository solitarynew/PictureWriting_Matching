My brother visited Changi Prison as part of an internship programme when he was in college. Together with two of his friends and a teacher, my brother made a trip to Changi Prison one Saturday morning. Security was tight and after going through several rounds of checks, my brother was finally introduced to the guide. Dressed in a uniform similar to the other guards, he welcomed them to the prison. My brother and his friends were shown around the prison compound. As they went around, they noticed barbed wire above all the walls. The guide explained that the barbed wire was very sharp and this would prevent prisoners from escaping. There was also a tower which was manned around the clock by some wardens. This was an effective way to catch would-be escapees. As it was not break time, the grounds outside were deserted and my brother was unable to see any of the activities and exercises that the prisoners participated in. My brother was shocked to see the prisoners' living quarters. The toilet and the bed were all within a cell and there was no privacy, especially if there were two cellmates in a cell. The metal bars of the cells made the place cold and unfeeling. When someone said that a man had mysteriously disappeared from one of the cells, it sent shivers down my brotherâ€™s spine. Just before leaving the place, my brother saw two prisoners standing behind the metal bars. They were unshaven and they looked tired and unhappy. Gripping the metal bars, they stared forlornly at my brother and his friends. The visit was indeed an eye-opening experience for my brother.
