My neighbourhood had always been quiet and peaceful. However, a year ago, my tranquil surrounding were greatly disrupted when a man, Brandon, moved int one of the flats on the twelfth floor of my block. Many of my neighbours averted their eyes whenever they saw Brandon. I too avoided looking at him. He had a pointed nose and a row of teeth that were as pointed as a shark's whenever he opened his mouth. His eyes were b and round and his black-rimmed spectacles only magnified his eyes even further. I had a frightening encounter with him one day after school. I was on my way home from school when I heard a snarl coming from behind one of the pillars. I peered around it and was stunned to see Brandon wielding a knife at an elderly lady. Her face was contorted with fear and she was clutching at her chest. Brandon demanded that she hand over her purse and all the jewellery that she was wearing. With trembling hands, the elderly lady gave Brandon her purse. He grabbed it, snatched the bracelet around he wrist and dashed off. The terrified lady crouched on the ground trembling with fear. hurried over immediately to help her to her feet Then, I took her to the nearby police station to make a report. I gave the police a vivid account of what I had witnessed. I also gave them Brandon's address. I was certain that they would apprehend him soon. That night, I told my parents what had happened. Everyone hoped that Brandon would be caught and would no longer stay in our neighbourhood.
