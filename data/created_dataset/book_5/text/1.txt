"I'm Popeye the Sailor Man (toot, toot), I'm Popeye the Sailor Man (toot, toot).." I sing the familiar tune to myself. It is the theme song of the cartoon which is played at the start of the programme. Popeye was one of my favourite programmes which I eagerly watched every evening when 1 was younger. It was a wonderful experience to watch Popeye become strong and muscular instantaneously after eating a can of spinach. His tattooed biceps would pop up to become a mass of muscles and he would be able to achieve superhuman feats. Eating spinach to gain strength was his trademark. My mother certainly approved of the cartoon for she used it to remind me of how important it was to eat vegetables. The cartoon depicted Popeye as a sailor. His love interest was a lanky girl called Olive, who was also wooed by Popeye's rival and archenemy, Brutus. Popeye was also shown as the underdog because of his small frame compared to Brutus, but his winning formula was his sincerity, kindness and of course, his trusty can of spinach. Whenever Brutus bullied Popeye or anyone else, Popeye would be the defender of justice and he would give Brutus a potent punch which was powered by his spinach. This winning formula would always melt Olive's heart and the episode would conclude with Olive in Popeye's arms again. Brutus would be nursing his sore body and his pride in a quiet corner. The moral of the story is that justice will prevail with the powers of sincerity, goodness and of course a good 'diet' in the form of spinach.
