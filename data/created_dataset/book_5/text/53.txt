"Listen to what your granny says, boy," advised my mother. "She may be old but she is still very alert about what is happening around her. She has also gone through a lot, so she can give you good advice. "Yes, Mum, I know and I will," I replied. My grandma is indeed a wise old woman. Unlike other grandmothers who might be frail, she is slightly plump and she always has a jolly smile on her wizened face. Although she is hard of hearing and has poor eyesight due to her advanced age, she is able to dispense advice like a wise old sage. Our family would always tell her about our problems and she would be able to advise us on what we should do There was once when I was feeling troubled because of the pressures and stress I faced in school, and I kept to myself without confiding in anyone for quite some time. However, my granny was able to sense my troubles and she decided to sound me out one day. After telling her my quandary, she gave me a warm and comforting smile and placed her hands gently on my shoulders. "Everything will turn out fine, my dear boy," she comforted. "Just try your best. I believe in you. I know you can do it." After listening to those words, I felt much better. I was encouraged to try harder in school. am glad that my grandma stays with us, so I can speak to her every day. She never fails to brighten up my day. Seeing her when I return home from school every day always helps to sooth my nerves.
