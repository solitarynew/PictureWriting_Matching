"Father, when will we have a chance to ride in caravan?" I asked. "Well son, write me a report on it first. If I'm satisfied with your writing.." Father replied nonchalantly "Okay, here it is!" I was well-prepared, knowing, father's disposition well enough in the United States, many families own caravans that are attached to their truck or any vehicle that can be towed. These caravans are like mobile homes with the basic necessities packed into it. In fact, many do live in caravans instead of conventional homes. Others just use the caravans for camping trips where they will drive up to a camp site and enjoy the great outdoors with their families and friends. As America is considerably huge, many families go on vacation visiting the many different states and cities in their caravans instead of flying off to a foreign destination. It s much more economical and the whole family can stay together just like they do in their own home. They would take family trips out to lakes and forests in their caravans without having to sacrifice the comfort of their own homes. It is thus a common sight to see many vehicles having their caravans in tow on the highways. There is no need for a hotel or motel. Whenever they feel tired during their journey, they can park in a secluded area to take a break in their own mobile cabin. It is indeed exciting to be on a holiday while taking your home along with you. smiled eagerly at my father. He was nodding as he read what I had written. I was hopeful that he would agree.
