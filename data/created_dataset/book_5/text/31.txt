Horror films are becoming more popular today. There are many different types of horror films. Some horror films are made using computer generated effects. These are more sophisticated than the older films which rely purely on make-up. Jane and Mary decided to watch a horror film one day which was directed by a renowned director. Armed with drinks and popcorn, they settled down comfortably in the first row of seats. They chatted happily while waiting for the show to start. They had never watched a horror film before and they scoffed at their friends who were always shaking with fear whenever they watched horror films. Silence fell over the theatre when the lights dimmed. Everyone looked at the screen expectantly. Jane was certain that the show would not be as scary as what the review claimed. However, all colour drained from her face when she saw the opening scene. A monster smiled menacingly revealing a pair of fangs. Blood was dripping from its mouth and it reached out for its first victim. Jane gripped the seat until her knuckles turned white. Mary was sitting at the edge of her seat staring wide- eyed at the screen. The zombie had a pair of scrawny arms with long and sharp fingernails. It was such a spine-tingling show that neither of the girls ate their popcorn. By the time it ended, their knees were so weak that they could hardly stand. Now they finally understood why their friends were so terrified whenever they watched a horror film.
