For one of our Social Studies lesson, our topic was on newspaper reporting. We learnt about the importance of newspapers and the various styles of reporting. We were also taught that sometimes newspaper reports could shape and change the outcome of events, thus being the most influential medium of information. We worked as a group on a project. My group decided to choose a topic on environmental issues that were currently being discussed by the leaders of different countries. We did not restrict ourselves to one newspaper, but searched from different sources and newspapers on a particular topic to compare the different styles and emphasis of reports. We finally settled on newspaper reports from five different countries. We then cut out the newspaper clippings that were relevant to our project. We also made many trips to the library to search through its digital records for past newspaper articles. There was so much information from the massive archives that it took us a long time to collate all the materials we needed. After the project was completed, we learnt a few vital lessons about newspapers. We learnt that not all newspapers used the same style. Some would sometimes try to portray a positive image of their own country. It was an informative project for us and we enjoyed doing it very much.
