Kelvin was the haughtiest boy in the class. His behaviour made everyone loath him. He would often scoff t others and make scornful remarks about their intelligence or their families. Everyone avoided him and treated him like an outcast. One day, Kelvin finally learnt his lesson. He had insulted his classmate, Jane. He said that she was useless because she same from a poor family. Jane burst into tears but Kelvin sniggered and even called her a crybaby. Overhearing this, the teacher came over and reprimanded Kelvin severely. She chided him for being rude and insensitive. Her voice rose as she carried on with her lecture. Everyone around stared. Some pointed their fingers at Kelvin and whispered that he deserved to get scolded. Kelvin did not dare look his teacher in the eye. He kept his eyes on the ground, his face red with embarrassment. Kelvin had never received such a dressing down before. He was so ashamed that he was on the verge of tears. With his eyes brimming with tears, he apologised to his teacher and promised to change his ways. However, it was difficult for a leopard to change its spots. It was not long before Kelvin reverted to his old self again. A week later, many students heard him mocking another classmate for being lousy in English.
