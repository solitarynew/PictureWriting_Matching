Last year, I went to a resort with my friends to celebrate my birthday. It was a cloudless day and the sun was blazing. We had an enjoyable time playing on the sand and in the sea. We had a delicious meal with an array of my favourite food. The highlight of the day was supposed to be after lunch. We were supposed to have a swimming competition in the sea and a sandcastle building competition as well. We were looking forward to the afternoon and we gobbled down our lunch before rushing out again. However, just as we were about to start the games, we began to feel tiny droplets. We ignored them, thinking that it was just a passing cloud. However, in a matter of minutes, the rain came pouring down. We stared at the sky in disbelief. The weather had been sunny for many weeks. How could it rain now? We could not believe our bad luck. Mary and Andrew, my two friends, suggested that we continue with our activities but I disagreed, telling them that it was impossible to do anything in the downpour. We hurried back to the resort where we were staying. We decided to play some indoor games instead. We were determined not to let the torrential rains ruin our day.
