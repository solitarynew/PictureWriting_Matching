My sister has an undying love for animals, particularly dogs. She loves all types of dogs, from tiny Chihuahuas to large German Shepherds. As such, she always finds the time to squeeze in some volunteer work at an animal shelter every weekend despite her busy schedule. Shedding her fashionable office suits for old and worn out T-shirts, she will make her way down to the animal shelter every Sunday. Her job there is mainly to clean the dog cages, bathe the dogs and ensure that their bowls of water are always filled. She will also feed them when it is mealtime. Many of the other volunteers turn down their noses at having to clean the dog cages. However, my sister's enthusiasm for the animals never falters even when she has to do such unpleasant tasks. She will clear the newspapers that were used to line the cages, wash the cages, dry them and line them with new newspapers again. She will happily clean cage after cage, never complaining of the smell. As the cages are on the ground, she has to squat to clean them. Water splashes all over her and sometimes, her slippers are soaked, but it does not bother her as she is doing something to help her favourite animals. Even though her back aches after a day of cleaning, my sister still finds time to play with the dogs. She tosses balls for them to catch, and evens rolls about with them, not minding the way they sometimes gnaw at her clothes and nibble her fingers. Her dedication is certainly rare among the volunteers at the shelter today. Hopefully there will be more volunteers like my sister in the future.
