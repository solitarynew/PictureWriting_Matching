That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. With those words, Neil Armstrong took those historic first steps that saw mankind overcoming the odds to walk on the moon. I must have seen those images of astronauts floating about on the moon numerous times. Every time I saw them, I wished that I too could be an astronaut. I had always been fascinated by the stars. I loved it when it was night because all the twinkling stars would appear in the dark sky. I loved the way the stars lit up the sky making the darkness less frightening. Counting the stars was a nightly ritual. My father bought me a telescope on my ninth birthday and it was one of the best presents that I ever received. Since there was an unblocked view of the sky from my twenty-fifth floor flat, I would be counting the stars and trying to identify as many constellations as possible almost every night. As I grew older. I learnt which formation was the Orion and which was the Big Dipper. I placed the telescope at a strategic spot in my balcony so that I would be able to see the sky. I would spend most of my nights after dinner peering through the telescope and gazing at the moon. Despite all these, I have yet to fulfil my dream. I often dream of being an astronaut so that I can feel the weightlessness of space and experience the vast expanse of the universe. I hope that if I study hard, my ambition would be within reach.
