With the increasing demands of school work today, many parents are turning to private tuition in an effort to help their children. There are many different types of tutors and it can be quite perplexing for many parents when it comes to selecting a tutor. The newspapers are often overwhelmed with advertisements claiming that they have the best tutors. With more and more teachers and non-teachers turning to tuition as a form of income, many tuition agencies have sprung up over the past few years. Many of the advertisements claim that they have tutors which are both effective and have cheap rates. The advertisements are usually brief and do not provide much information about the tutors. Apprehensive parents have many questions which the advertisements are unable to answer. They will then have to call the agencies or the tutors personally to find out more. Parents also have to ensure that the tutors are suitable for their children, It is a difficult task to find one that suits the temperament of the child. Sometimes it is only through trial and error that the best tutor can be found for a child. Some parents send their children to tuition centres near their homes. These centres usually conduct group tuition classes with ten to fifteen students per class. These might not be suitable for everyone. It is more effective for some children to study at home with a tutor. Such individual classes are more beneficial for these children. Parents have many points to bear in mind when choosing a tutor. On top of these, an element of luck is also necessary when selecting a private tutor.
