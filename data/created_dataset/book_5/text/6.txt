Bang! Bang! The old man crouched on the tiny wooden stool had a surprisingly large amount of strength. surrounding him were insoles, small black rubber pieces, numerous pairs of shoes and a box of tools. I was amazed that such a frail looking man could sit for hours, bent over a wooden pole, hammering with all his might. walked over to talk to him. He told me that his name was Ah Huat and he had been working as a cobbler since he was a young boy. To my surprise, he was from a rich family but he decided to venture out on his own instead of joining his family business. Ah Huat worked tirelessly. Not once did he turn to look at me. His eyes never left the shoes that he was mending. He mended shoe after shoe, sometimes polishing and cleaning those that were old and dusty. While I was talking to him, a lady came up to drop off her shoes. She turned up her nose at him and spoke to him in a rude manner. However, Ah Huat continued to smile and nod. He was not offended or annoyed. Amazed, I asked him how he could continue being so polite to those who did not treat him with respect. He just smiled and told me of the importance of just doing his jab well had an interesting time talking to Ah Huat. I marvelled at his fine workmanship and vowed to bring my shoes to him if the need arose. I also learnt a valuable lesson from Ah Huat. No matter how small the job is, we should always do it properly and with pride.
