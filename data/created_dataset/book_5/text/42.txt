There was once a great and luxurious ship built at the beginning of the twentieth century to ferry passengers across the Atlantic from England to the United States. It was the most magnificent and majestic ship ever built then. The builders of the ship even claimed that it was an unsinkable ship because of its mammoth size, thus named the Titanic. The ship set sail on its maiden voyage with great publicity. Thousands were on the waiting list for many months to be the first to experience the once-in-a-lifetime journey on this ship. Many famous names and aristocrats had the chance to savour the grandiose interiors of the ship while the common folk too had a great time, but in the lower class cabins. However, disaster struck in the middle of the Atlantic because the captain and crew of the ship were too complacent and careless. It was the middle of the night when tragedy struck. Failure to keep a look out, together with poor visibility caused the ship to navigate directly into an iceberg. Initially, not many of the passengers and crew on the ship thought much of the slight turbulence. However, water began leaking into the ship, starting at the lower decks. Many scrambled for the limited places on the few lifeboats. It did not take long before the boat sank. Many passengers either drowned or froze to death in the ice-cold ocean within hours of the accident. As the saying goes, 'The greater they are, the harder they fall' The great Titanic that was not supposed to sink, sunk hopelessly and quickly on its first voyage across the Atlantic. It lay at the bottom of the ocean, and even today, many are still making dives to search for artefacts from the once majestic ship.
