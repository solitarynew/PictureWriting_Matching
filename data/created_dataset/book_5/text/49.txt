During the December vacation, my family and I went on a tour to America. We boarded the Pacific bound flight to Los Angeles which was also called the 'City of Angels'. Since we slept throughout the trip there, we did not feel that we had actually travelled for more than ten hours in the plane. Once we arrived, we proceeded to Orange County, which was the place for our fun and exciting Disney holiday. The following day, a bus took us to the well-known Disneyland. We were given one-day unlimited passes to Disneyland. I was filled with awe the minute I stepped into the place. It was exactly as I had seen it in the brochures and on the Internet. I was overwhelmed by the huge place initially, but I soon found my way around by using a map. What thrilled me the most was getting to meet all my favourite Disney characters. It was like a cartoon that had come to life. I shook their hands and took countless of pictures with them. Whenever I spotted a Disney character walking on the road, I would stop to take a photograph with it. I knew that there were people inside the characters. These people were merely wearing costumes to make them look like the characters. However, just for that day, I chose to live in a fantasy world, pretending that I was really in a magical land of many talking animals and creatures. also saw a huge gorilla. It was actually a robot and it was holding a human figurine in its palms. Although it looked scary, I still wanted to take a photograph with it. I enjoyed my trip to Disneyland very much. I begged my parents to take me there again soon. When we returned to Singapore, I arranged all my photographs of the trip into an album. It was indeed a memorable trip.
