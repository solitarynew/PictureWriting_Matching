I attended a fabulous performance given by our school choir club two years ago. I was so enthralled by their singing that during the recruitment drive, I jumped at the chance to sign up with them. Every other day, I stayed back in school for choir practice and meetings. The choir mistress often encouraged us to practise singing whenever we could. The senior members would also give us tips on how to improve our singing and our breathing. We were intrinsically motivated and passionate about improving our singing. Sometimes, I went off key and my voice would immediately stand out. My face would turn red with embarrassment and I would apologise to everyone. There was a national schools choir competition held during the June holidays last year. Although I was only a new member with not much experience and expertise in singing, I was good enough to be selected to join the team sent for the competition. Keyed up, I trained very hard for it. I would stay back in school every day and spend whole Saturdays practising for the competition. On the day of the competition, we were all on edge. We tried our best to stay calm and we sang superbly. After weeks of practise, we were able to reach the high notes. After our performance, there was a rousing applause. We were over the moon when we won the championship. The competition was the highest accolade for school choirs and our principal and teachers were very pleased with the results. We were praised for all the effort we had put in.
