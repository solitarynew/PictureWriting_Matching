Most supermarkets had discounts on certain items throughout the year. Being a thrifty person, my mother often looked out for these discounts so that she would be able to save some money when purchasing household supplies. Every Thursday morning, my mother would grab the newspapers and search eagerly for the discount coupons from a supermarket in our housing estate. Thursday was the day when the supermarket advertised its weekly specials. There would be a page full of discount coupons on selected products. My mother would go through all the coupons and religiously take note of any discounts that attracted her attention. She would spend at least one hour pouring over the newspaper comparing prices with other supermarkets and deciding which of the products to buy. She would then cut out the relevant coupons from the newspaper before keeping them in her wallet. Satisfied with her haul, my mother would then go shopping at the supermarket. It did not matter that she had to buy many heavy and bulky items. She would lug all her purchases home herself, pleased with the bargains. Although I thought that it was tedious to search for coupons every week, I was impressed by my mother's determination to get the best deals. I was also grateful for what she was doing for the family.
