While vacationing in Australia, we came across people performing in the streets, hoping to earn some money from kind donations for their acts. As we were not in a hurry, we decided to stroll along the sidewalk to enjoy the performances. The first performance we watched was a violinist. Dressed in a short brown jacket and matching pants with a glittery belt, he played one familiar tune after another. There was a large amount of applause each time he finished a piece. Next, we watched several jugglers. They were certainly as good as the professionals that I saw on television. They started out juggling just bowling pins, but later, they progressed to lighted torches, and fragile looking porcelain dishes. Not one of the dishes was broken nor did the flames burn them. The jugglers were indeed fantastic. The most exciting performance was by a troupe of acrobats. Their daredevil performances thrilled the onlookers. They tried many neck-breaking stunts with ease. The onlookers gasped and cheered as they watched the stunts. Their most death defying and interesting performance was their unicycle act. The act seemed harmless and simple at first, with an acrobat balancing himself on a unicycle. We got a shock when another suddenly appeared and jumped onto the shoulders of the acrobat on the unicycle. Moments later, a third acrobat did the same act, except that he was now balancing on the shoulders of the second acrobat. There were three acrobats balancing precariously on a unicycle. This act drew tremendous applause as the audience stared at the acrobats in awe. At the end of the performances, constant clanging sounds could be heard as onlookers tossed coins into 'donation boxes'. We left after donating some money as well. I turned back once to look at the performers and saw them bowing to everyone and saying in unison how grateful they were for everyone's donation. The box was filled to the brim with both coins and notes.
