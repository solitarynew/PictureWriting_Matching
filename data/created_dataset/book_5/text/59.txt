My mother's motto when it comes to a sale at a departmental store is, "The early bird catches the worm'. This motto fits her perfectly because she will always be the first one at the entrance on the first day of the sale. Her rationale is that she will be able to grab the best products at a bargain if she goes during the first hour. My mother also shares her belief with a few of my aunts. She is always the first to know which departmental store will be having their sale even before it is advertised in the newspapers. She then shares this information with her shopping buddies and they will make plans to 'attack' the departmental store together. It does not matter if the place s packed with people. My mother will always manage to find the best bargains. She will squeeze past people and rummage in the boxes. Nothing fazes her. She always makes sure that she finds what she wants. She will be laden with bags whenever she returns from a sale. "You will have to cook your own dinner. I'm going out," my mother told me. She had a gleam in her eye and a lightness in her step. She had just finished talking to Aunt Shelley. I suspected that she was going to another sale again. That night, I heard my mother returning home as was about to doze off. Her laughter rang out and I could hear her chatting excitedly to my father about what she had bought from the store. I grinned. I could not wait to rummage through her bags to see what she had bought the next morning.
