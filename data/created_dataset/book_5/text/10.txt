Gone were those days when my father would take me to watch a puppet show performed nightly in close proximity to our old flat at Redhill estate. It was fun taking a trip down with my father to watch the puppet show. The show attracted many other children and we would all crowd around the stage to get a better view. The puppet show was a one-man show, whereby the puppeteer would control all the puppets by himself and he would alter his voice for each character. Sometimes, the changes were so exaggerated that we would all burst out laughing. His voice impersonation was very goad and convincing, often hilarious. One day, he had a bad sore throat. We knew he had one owing to his 'all-male' puppet characters with coarse voices, and the absence of female characters. We could not stop laughing when he introduced tomboyish female character in the voice of a macho man. I was inspired by the puppeteer's talent and wanted to be like him when I grew up. After every performance, I would look him up and persuade him to teach me some skills. Nonetheless, before I could pick up a tenth of his skills, he kicked the bucket in an ill-fated car accident. I wonder if I will have a chance to watch such puppet shows again. I have seen similar stages and puppets on display at the museum. I hope that such performances will one day be revived.
