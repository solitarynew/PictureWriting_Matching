The curtain had already come down an hour ago. Sandra walked to the edge of the stage looking down at the auditorium where the audience had stood an hour ago, applauding her excellent performance. Today had been the most important day of Sandra's life as her performance determined her entry to a world famous ballet troupe. Her performance was beyond reproach. She danced and twirled non-stop to the music, completely losing herself in the music. She went on and on without even missing a beat. All her years of practice had paid off when the audience gave her a standing ovation. Sandra bowed so many times after her performance that her back ached. She smiled so hard that her mouth ached as well. The director of the eminent ballet troupe was waiting for her backstage to inform her that she had been selected. Sandra was overwhelmed with joy. All the years of hard work had finally paid off. At sixteen, she was the youngest ballerina ever to join the troupe. She was born with the gift to dance. The arduous hours of practice also attributed to her success. Now standing on the stage, Sandra's body tingled with excitement as she thought of what her life would be like now that she was part of the troupe. She knew that she would have to work much harder than before, but she did not mind, for dancing and performing on stage was her dream.
