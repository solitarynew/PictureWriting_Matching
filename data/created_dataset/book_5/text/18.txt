It is the year 2495. Man has perfected the art and science of space travel. Voyaging through the galaxies is similar to travelling on a jet plane from Singapore to Japan which can be accomplished in less than a day. Many new cities and towns are created not on Earth, but in outer space among the infinite stars and planets. Wid is a suave and handsome first officer on board a luxury spaceship. While making his rounds one night, he came across a stunningly gorgeous young lady on the space voyage. Initially, he did not pay much attention to her, regarding her like any other passenger. However, as time went by on the long journey, their paths crossed numerous times. One evening, he met her at the dining room when he was off-duty. As the lady, Lenny, was alone by herself, Wid went over to introduce himself. She was captivated by the gentlemanly man in uniform and she cordially invited him to join her for dinner. He was great at telling jokes and she giggled non-stop as he spoke. Although Wid was unable to spend much time with Lenny on the spaceship, he made sure that they met for dinner every night. They found out that they had a lot in common and promised to keep in touch after returning to earth. Wid could not believe how lucky he was to have met someone he could get along with on the spaceship. There were numerous passengers, yet he was able to spot Lenny and befriend her.
