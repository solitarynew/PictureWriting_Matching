It was a week to my examinations and I was beginning to panic. I had not been consistent in my won and I realised that I had a lot of revision to do. To top it off. my parents had presented an excellent incentive for me to study hard- a trip to Europe if 1 did well for my examinations. However, less than an hour into my revision, my eyelids felt heavy and I could feel the pen slipping from my fingers. The words were blurring and I had to blink a few times to check if I was reading the correct line. After five minutes of reading the same line, I decided to take forty winks I rested my head on the table and it was not long before I was in dreamland. "Wake up! You've only completed two questions and there are many more to go! What's happening?" My teacher's voice resounded in my ear. I woke up with a start and looked around me. Everyone was busy writing their answers. I stared down at my paper and realised I had hardly even begun. My mind was a blank and I froze in fear. I began to perspire profusely, willing myself to think of what to write. Looking at my watch only increased the level of fear. I only had ten more minutes. "This cannot be happening!" I screamed, tugging at my hair. "Wake up! You fell asleep while studying. Why don't you go to bed now? Continue revising tomorrow," said a soothing voice. I opened my eyes and was relieved to see my mother's familiar face looking down at me.
