In 1997, many countries experienced the harsh realities of the El Nino effect. This was the time when there was a drastic change in the weather system and many countries either faced severe droughts or floods. This was due to a fluctuation of the weather patterns in the environment. Countries in Southeast Asia suffered greatly because of this. Regular monsoon seasons that were supposed to bring rains to the rainforests in Indonesia and other parts in the region did not occur. Since these countries relied on the monsoon seasons to bring the rains they needed to grow their crops, the lack of rain greatly affected the harvest. Many countries faced a drought, causing the ground to be dry and susceptible to forest fires. To make matters worse, the forest fires in Indonesia and Borneo resulted in a haze, which blanketed the whole region with smoke and dust particles. Due to a drought, there was not enough rain to put out the forest fires and winds were not strong enough to blow away the heavy dust particles that hung over the atmosphere. Fortunately, countries in these regions did not face a severe water shortage due to conservation efforts. Water was used wisely and supplies were enough to last throughout the drought. Nevertheless, this has indeed taught us that environmental problems are no longer a country's affair. They go beyond the boundaries of just one country and affect other countries as well. Yet, in other countries, torrential rains led to floods, which caused entire regions to become lakes. Homes were submerged in water and buildings were destroyed. People became homeless overnight and many lost their lives in lash floods. Extreme weather conditions affect people's lives greatly. Sometimes, these occur so suddenly, that it is difficult to escape. The result is the death of many people and the destruction of buildings and homes.
