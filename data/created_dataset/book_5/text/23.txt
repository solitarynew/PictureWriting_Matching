The jungles and rainforests of many tropical countries are home to many different species. The number and range of species living in these habitats are so wide and vast that many different species are still undiscovered. Unfortunately, these jungles and rainforests have peen greatly destroyed by man. Many creatures that make these places their home, have had their homes destroyed. These are only creatures that man is aware of. There could also be the existence of a particular species which might have been killed or annihilated even before they were discovered. Since ancient times, man has cleared forests for agriculture and living space. What once used to be lush greenery have become cities and farms in just a matter of years or even months as technology advances. In just a matter of minutes, man has also chopped down trees that may have taken decades to become tall and strong. Furthermore, for every tree destroyed, hundreds of other species that may have made their home on that tree are destroyed or made vulnerable to the harsh environment. Like any other environmental woes, deforestation is yet another major problem that has few solutions. Conservationists and industries are often in conflict with one another in trying to solve this problem. Till then, we may have to live with the sad reality that our forests and many other living creatures will be threatened or unwittingly made extinct.
