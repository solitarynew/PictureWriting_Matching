My family owns the neighbourhood confectionery and my uncle is the main confectioner. Yat Koon Confectionery has been in the business for over seventy years. My uncle has been in this line for so long that he has earned the respect of well known confectioners from all over the world. Although my uncle's job is to make the bread and cakes, he often does more than that. He buys supplies like flour and sugar himself, often carrying them on his shoulder for long distances from the shops to the confectionery. He never complains of the backbreaking work. In fact, he often jokes that it is his form of exercise. Although my uncle has several helpers whom he supervises, he often prefers to do the work himself. I sometimes suspect that he does not trust anyone else to make the bread and cakes. My uncle sets high standards for his helpers and will reprimand them harshly whenever they slack in their work. My uncle is very particular about the texture and appearance of the bread as well as the aroma. He says that customers will not come back again if the bread is not well baked. He is certainly right for people are often drawn to the confectionery after they get a whiff of the scent of freshly baked bread. Besides making the bread and cakes for sale, my uncle also makes sure that he gets to know his customers He knows many of them by name now and they often stop to chat with him whenever they are in the confectionery Sometimes, my uncle listens to what they like to eat and uses that as ideas for his new creations. I hope that my uncle will continue to work in the confectionery for a long time to come. His passion for bread and cake making helps him to produce aromatic and delicious food. I hope to be able to pick up some skills from him one day.
