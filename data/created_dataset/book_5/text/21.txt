The ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun. When our skin is over exposed to these UV rays, skin cancer and other kinds of diseases would result in our bodies. The ozone layer is thus a natural defence against such harmful UV rays radiating from the sun. However, the ozone layer has been depleting from our atmosphere in recent years. This has led scientists to call it a "hole in the sky. The "hole' is actually the loss of the ozone layer in the atmosphere as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) attack the ozone layer and cause a breakdown in the molecules that form the ozone layer. These CFCs are emitted from various aerosol cans and refrigerators. The Styrofoam cups, plants and containers that we are so familiar with also cause the ozone layer to deplete. These items have become very much a part of daily life. Furthermore, they have proven exceptionally convenient, especially items like Styrofoam cups and plastic containers and bags that not many people are willing to stop using them. Fortunately, all is not lost. Governments and industries have realised the pressing need to protect our environment, and the ozone layer is one of their priorities. Many countries have cut down on using aerosols and have replaced CFC emitting refrigerators with industrial products that are CFC-free. Efforts have also been made by companies to make it worthwhile for people to switch to items that do not damage the environment such as the use of recycled bags instead of plastic bags. As a result, there has been a significant decrease in ozone depletion in our atmosphere. However, we cannot remain complacent with the results. We need to continually strive to make improvements to the items that we use, so that future generations can enjoy a wonderful and safe environment.
