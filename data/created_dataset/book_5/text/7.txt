"I'm the best shepherd around!" Joseph boasted as he pressed his staff firmly on the ground. Unlike children his age who were studying and living in the city, Joseph had chosen to remain on his grandparentsâ€™ farm to help them. He preferred farmlife to citylife. He enjoyed the uncomplicated farmlife. was just after breakfast that morning when Joseph took the flock of sheep to graze in the fields as usual However, he was especially alert that morning. He had heard news that a wolf was in the area and he did not want to be caught off guard. Joseph adored his sheep and did not want anything to happen to them. Together with his loyal sheepdog, Ariel, Joseph felt that they were a formidable team and could defeat any wolf. That morning, as usual, he left them to graze in the field while he sat under a shady tree. However, before long he heard them bleating furiously and those who had strayed further away returned to the flock. The sheep huddled together in the middle of the field. Alarmed, Joseph immediately returned to his flock to take charge. As he was counting the sheep, he heard the constant barking of Ariel in the distance. Joseph rushed to where the sound was coming from. To his horror, one of the weaker sheep had been caught by the wolf. It was shaking with terror, while the wolf growled menacingly at it. Joseph was about to rush forward to save his sheep when Ariel ran past him. Pouncing on the wolf, she scratched it and bit it as hard as she could. The stunned wolf gave a yelp before running away. Joseph rushed forward to pick up the sheep. After a quick examination, he was relieved to find out that the sheep had not been injured. Patting Ariel on the head, Joseph praised her for being so brave. Then, with the rest or the sheep, they returned to the farmhouse. That afternoon, Joseph gave Ariel an extra portion of her favourite dog biscuits. He was glad that she had been around. Without Ariel, the sheep would surely have been devoured by the ferocious wolf.
