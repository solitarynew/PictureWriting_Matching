"After you," Sam gestured as he turned to open the door for his partner. Sam was indeed a chivalrous man. His actions never failed to please his friends and family. Being in the constant company of his sisters and their friends, Sam grew up learning how to treat females well. He was labelled a gentleman and he often pulled out the chairs for ladies during meal times. He also held doors open for ladies and made sure that he always let them walk before him. Through his sisters, he learnt about the way girls should be treated and the way they thought. Not surprisingly, many ladies were charmed by his sincerity and gallantry. His trait stood out among the other men. Ladies around him liked talking and spending time with him. Even when he was faced with a group of women, Sam's composed manners enabled him to fit in comfortably with the group. His sense of humour allowed him to engage in interesting conversations which often impressed the ladies However, Sam's behaviour was not restricted to young ladies. He also treated the elderly well. He often accompanied his grandmother on walks in the park, helping her along as she walked. His patience and compassionate nature allowed him to get along very well with the elderly. Sam's behaviour should certainly be emulated by many men. Not many people could behave the way he did.
