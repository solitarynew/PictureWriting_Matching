Whenever I read the newspapers, I will not fail to read the comics section. It is a joy to read it, as sometimes the comic strips are really funny. I enjoy reading a comic strip called "Garfield' because it is humorous. The punchlines of the lazy cat can really bring tears of laughter to my eyes. It has been my favourite comic since I started reading it. The Garfield column has been printed in the newspapers for many years now. It was created by an American cartoonist, Jim Davis. It is about a rotund and slothful cat and its owner. What makes the comic funny are the weird antics of the characters and the situations they get into. For example, Garfield loves to sing to an audience while perched high up on a wall. However, his audience does not enjoy listening to him sing. In fact, they abhor it. They will either ignore him or throw rubbish at him to stop his awful singing. The punch line comes when Garfield is adamant about his shortcomings and just says that his audience does not know how to appreciate him. Besides reading Garfield, I enjoy reading other comics too. These are a stress-reliever for me from my busy day at school. After school, I will definitely find the time to relax with my favourite comic strip.
