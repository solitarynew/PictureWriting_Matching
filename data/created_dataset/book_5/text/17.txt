James rushed to the window. A flashing light appeared in the sky. The light flashed on and off. It moved nearer, swooping down suddenly; then flying back up again On impulse he dashed out of his house to see what the object was. Even before he reached the field, James knew that the object had already landed. He could feel a gust of wind and he could see a shadow on the grass. He wondered if there was any danger and if he should back away, but suddenly, a group of aliens emerged from the object. James shook his head in disbelief because he had always mocked his friends when they told him about aliens. James experienced a mixture of fear and excitement. He wondered if the aliens meant any harm. He waited, not daring to move from the spot where he was standing. To his surprise, one of the aliens disappeared from the group and then appeared almost immediately in front of him. Jumping back in fright, James was ready to turn and run back but he saw what looked like a smile on the alien's face Its mouth curled up slightly and it extended a hand to shake James'. Speechless, James could only gape in wonder at the alien. It was even stranger still when the alien started to speak, not in any obscure language but English. James grinned when he realised that the alien was harmless and it just wanted to befriend him. They sat on the grass in the garden, talking about alien and human life as though they were long time friends. James discovered many interesting things about alien culture and realised that the aliens were actually a superior race that was more technologically advanced than humans and were also able to mimic human behaviour easily. By the time the alien bid James farewell, it was almost evening. They had been talking for more than two hours. James waved as the spaceship lifted off slowly from the ground, heading back to outer space. James wondered if he would ever see his alien friend again.
