My grandmother is an avid Chinese Opera fan. She loves watching opera performances and is an early bird at any opera performance. Her love for opera started a long time ago. During her younger days, my grandmother's passion for Chinese Opera was at its peak. She would watch every opera performance and she even befriended a famous opera singer. My grandmother, together with many other fans would troop backstage after the performances to get a closer look at the opera singer. They would marvel at his heavy headgear and look in amazement at the thick layer of makeup that everyone, even the men, had to use. Their makeup made them unrecognisable. Once, when I saw the performers after they had removed their makeup, I was surprised that they behaved like any man in the street. The opera singer, despite being famous, was a humble and unassuming man. He was willing to chat with his excited fans, He would relate his experiences as an opera singer, telling everyone about all the training and practices he had to put in especially before a major performance. My grandmother used to give the singer many gifts and flowers whenever she went backstage. She soon found out what type of flowers he liked and would buy him a bouquet for each performance. My grandmother's actions made her so prominent that she stood out among the rest of the fans. She became friends with the opera singer and they often went out together. She stopped gaping at him whenever she saw him. Although she still admired him for his talent, she treated him like she did any of her friends. My grandmother lost contact with the singer when he moved to Australia to work. However, a few months ago, he returned to Singapore and contacted my grandmother again. Although both of them have aged greatly since the last time they met, they are still able to communicate with each other as well as before. They spent hours talking to each other and promised to keep in touch by email when he returned to Australia.
