There were many youngsters in my housing estate. They often loitered in the neighbourhood at night and during the day on weekends. They did not leave a good impression as they were often untidily dressed, had ear and nose piercings, were covered in tattoos and smoked heavily. Many of the older generation frowned at their dressing and behaviour. They felt that these youngsters were an annoyance and were disturbing the peaceful environment of the neighbourhood. Their boisterous voices could be heard even in the flats upstairs. Their laughter rang out eerily in the dead of the night, rudely awakening those who had already gone to bed. There were three prominent youngsters in my estate They stood out among the others because of their dressing and manner. Although they were all boys, they chose to go against the norms of society by having long hair and wearing chunky jewellery such as earrings, bracelets and necklaces. They spoke in a mixture of dialect and Mandarin. Many people avoided looking at them as there was a rumour that they would beat up those who stared at them. However, no one thought that they were anything more than a nuisance until one day, one of them was caught doing something illegal-he stole. He looked like he was the most notorious of the lot as he was much taller, bigger size and had a gruff voice. He was standing stealthily behind a lady with an open tote bag. He had just taken out her wallet when a young boy spotted him. Thief!' he had shouted. The youngster immediately dropped the wallet on the floor and ran off. However, it was too late. A police officer saw what had happened and arrested the youngster before he could run far. Once that youngster was arrested, the other youngsters stopped hanging around in the void deck. The residents no longer saw them there in the day. Occasionally, they would see them at night. However, they were much quieter than before.
