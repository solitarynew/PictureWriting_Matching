I have three sisters and a brother in my family. The eldest among us is my brother, Mike, who is an ardent adventurer. He loves the outdoors and would participate in all kinds of adventurous expeditions and activities. He has trekked many mountains around the region and tried all sorts of activities like parachuting and scuba diving. He is the pluckiest among all of us. Whenever he takes leave from work, Mike will go scuba diving with his friends. He enjoys looking at the colourful corals in the sea and moving among the schools of fish. He often tells me that he always feels at one with marine life when swimming among the fish. He always has interesting pictures to show me which are taken from his underwater camera. Parachuting is another of his favourite activities. His initial fear of heights has disappeared and he loves the feel of floating in the air among the clouds. He says that the rush of air he feels whenever the door of the plane is opened is exhilarating. Mike has a great sense of adventure. His boldness and courage helped to make headlines last year when he was selected to be part of an expedition to climb Mount Everest. What was even more awe-inspiring was that he was the only team member to make it to the mountain summit and back safely when the others were too weak or injured to do so. He recounted that he could not give up after training so hard and spending so much time up in the harsh mountain environment. He said he persevered and climbed the last few metres to reach the top. He told us that the view from the top was marvellous. Mike received a rousing welcome when he came back from Mount Everest that day. Seeing how happy and satisfied my brother is with the activities that he participate in. I have decided to take part in them when I am older. He has promised to take me with him next time.
