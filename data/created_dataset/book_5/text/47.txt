During the March holidays, my parents decided to take me on a cruise. We had heard so much about the cruise ship that we decided to take advantage of a promotional offer. We booked a three-day cruise to nowhere. This meant that the ship would sail along the high seas and return to Singapore without stopping anywhere else When the day of departure arrived, I woke up exceptionally early and urged my parents to leave as soon as possible as I was afraid that the ship would leave without us. My parents laughed at how excited I was and agreed to leave early. After checking-in, we boarded the ship. We were given a warm welcome by the crew. The ship was huge with several levels that made it look like a huge shopping mall We were ushered into our rooms on the sixth level by the friendly staff. There were many activities that were planned by the crew. Morning exercises and games were attended by almost every passenger on the ship. Karaoke was also among some of the numerous activities that kept us occupied. My family's passion for singing was well met when we saw the large rooms available for Karaoke. We immediately made a beeline for the place and spent most o our time there. My father and I sang our favourite songs and my mother clapped along to the music. The other exciting part about the cruise was the fantastic buffets that were served in the restaurant. I could not resist the mouth watering food and I stuffed myself continuously during the three days. After spending three relaxing and enjoyable days on the cruise ship, we arrived back in Singapore. We had such a great time that we looked forward to another cruise.
