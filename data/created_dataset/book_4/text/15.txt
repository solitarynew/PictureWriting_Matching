on a trip to Australia last yearï¼Œpart of theitinerary was a farm visit. When my family and l arrivedat the farm, we were served with some refreshmentsand given some hot towels to freshen us up after ourweary journey.
The air at the farm was cool and refreshing. ltwas the opposite of the warm and polluted climate backin our green city. We could see animals roaming aboutfreely and the environment was tranquil and serene.The mountains in the horizon made the place pictureperfect. The scenery resembled a painting. l tooknumerous pictures of the vast countryside and theexpanse of lush bright green grass with colourfulflowers dotted everywhere.
The guide cum farmer showed us around thefarm. He took us to see the milking of cows and sheepshearing. We were filled with a gamut of indescribablefeelings while experiencing farm life.At times, I had to
pinch my nose so that l would not have to breathe inthe pungent smell. At times, the smells from the farm
rejuvenated me. l enjoyed trying my hand at milking thecow, but it was certainly hard work.
we ended the visit by eating delicious farm freshfood cooked by the farmer's wife. It was a memorableday, indeed.
