Glenda buttoned her fitting long sleeved whiteshirt.Then she put on her knee length grey skirt.Finally,she slipped on her long sleeved matching grey jacket.She tucked her hair behind her ears and smiled at herreflection in the mirror. Pleased with the way shelooked, she swung her handbag onto her shoulder andleft the house.My sister was a waitress. She had beenworking at a restaurant since she completed herstudies.
Her job as a waitress was to take orders,servethe food and clear the tables.Together with the otherwaiters and waitresses, she had to sweep and clear upthe place after the restaurant closed.My sister enjoyedserving the customers. She liked telling them about thesignature dishes and giving them a list of the populardishes.
The most difficult task was serving the food, as alot of balancing skills and strength were needed toaccomplish this task. lf she was careless,the plateswould drop and break,and her manager wouldreprimand her. when she first started, she could onlycarry one dish at a time. She even dropped a bowl ofhot soup once. However,after a while,her skillsimproved and she was able to balance heavy trays filledwith dishes. She could even hold them with one hand.
Weekends were the most hectic time for thestaff, as the restaurant was packed with customers. Allthe staff were busy serving and taking orders.Oncecustomers left, they also had to clear the table for thenext customers. lf the service was not efficient, therewould be complaints from customers.
Despite her stressful job, she enjoyed it becauseshe was fortunate to have friendly colleagues who werealways willing to lend her a helping hand. She was eventhinking of taking up courses in hospitality when sheentered the university so that she could one day bepromoted to head waitress.
