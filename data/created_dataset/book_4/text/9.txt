My brother's colleagueï¼ŒFred,was the mostrepulsive person my brother had ever met. He wasunaware of how his behaviour offended and disgustedothers.
Whenever they had lunch together,he wouldtalk stridently and use vulgarities at anyone whoperturbed him.This included the stallholders as well asother customers around him. He also slurped his foodand chewed with his mouth open, revealing everythingin his mouth. He also liked to talk when he waschewing, often spitting out saliva and bits of food at mybrother. My brother tried to keep his distance and oftenpretended to be so engrossed in his food that he didnot want to talk to Fred. Fred also made a messwhenever he ate. Soup would dribble down his chin andgrains of rice would be everywhere on the table and onthe floor.
At work, Fred would talk loudly on the telephoneto his clients without any consideration for others. Hisother colleagues dared not confront him directlybecause a female colleague got a tongue-lashing fromhim once when she politely asked him to lower hisvoice.She went away crying after he scolded her for notbeing tolerant towards others.
Fortunately, Fred's overconfidence and obnoxiousbehaviour offended one of the company's clients andhe was fired from his job. Fred was finally made to eathumble pie. My brother and all the other colleagueswere so relieved that they held a celebration after heleft.
