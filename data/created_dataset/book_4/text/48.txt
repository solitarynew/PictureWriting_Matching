Feeling bored,Patrick decided to make a trip tohis favourite neighbourhood store. It was a popularvideo shop which usually stocked some of the latestshows. Having been there countless of timesï¼ŒPatrickknew the place like the back of his hand. He wentdirectly to the section where the latest shows weredisplayed.
lt did not take long for Patrick to find threeshows that he liked.He was indecisive about which oneto borrow and decided to borrow all of them. As theshows were popular ones,Patrick had to return all ofthem the next day. He paid for the shows and left theshop happily.
The minute he reached home,Patrick prepared ajug of ice-cold orange juice and opened a packet ofpotato chips.Then, he settled down to watch the first ofthe shows. He had a fantastic time. He watched filmafter film. He laughed heartily at the humorous partsand sniffed loudly when the characters were unhappy.He was so engrossed in his shows that he did not hearthe key turning in the lock. His parents had returnedhome from work.
Patrick jumped up in fright when he heard hisparents calling him. The timing of the shows wasperfect. The credits of the last show had just ended.Switching off the television, he ran to greet his parents.
