â€œWhat is that?" Brenda exclaimed as she pointedat a dark object in the distance. It was half hidden in thesand."lt is moving!"
l squinted at the dark mass in front of me. l couldnot make out what it was.At first, I thought it was justlitter."There! That thing over there! It's moving!"Brenda shrieked. Finally,l saw a dull-looking creaturetrying to burrow in the sand. l immediately suggestedtaking a closer look.
Without another word,Brenda darted towardsthe creature moving about in the sand. When we took acloser look, we realised that the creature had a pair ofpincers and a hard shell. lt should have been anordinary crab. What made it look strange was the fur onits shell.
"What kind of crab is this?" Brenda queried asshe peered at the crab."Why does it have so much furon its body? lt is like a little chick."
"It is a crab.Look, there are its pincers," l said aswe took another closer look."But l don't know whatkind of a crab it is.Let's move on."
We went on our way after that. l turned backonce to take another look at the crab. However, it haddisappeared. l saw it a short distance away burrowingitself into the sand. l was surprised by how fast it couldmove. l smiled to myself as l wondered if we could havecaught it for dinner that night.
