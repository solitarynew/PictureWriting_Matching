The sun is blazing down from a clear blue sky.There is not a single cloud in the sky to blockthe scorching sunrays from penetrating the Earth'satmosphere. The temperature soars to thirty-fivedegrees Celsius.It is one of those Sundays in the middleof July when there is no rain and the weather isextremely hot.
Despite the stifling Sunday afternoon, my friendand l are enjoying ourselves at the beach in East CoastPark. We have been working very hard for our tests thepast few weeks and we are taking this opportunity toenjoy ourselves out in the sun. We have been coopingourselves up in the library for the past few weeks.Evenour usually tanned faces have turned pale. Hence, wedecided to spend a day at the beach.
Although many people will rather stay indoors intheir air-conditioned rooms to avoid the oppressiveheat, it is a blessing for us. We lie on our mats to get asuntan and play in the sea. lt is refreshing to feel thecool water splash against our bare backs while the sunbeats down on us.
My friend and l cannot wait for the chance tospend another day at the beach. Hopefully, the skieswill be just as clear then.
