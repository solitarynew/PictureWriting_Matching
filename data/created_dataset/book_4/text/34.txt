Charles gazed out at the tarmac where the planewas waiting. He could hardly wait to board the plane.He was on his way to Hong Kong. lt was his first tripthere.
When Charles arrived slightly after three hours,Hong Kong was exactly what he pictured it to be.Thestreets were bustling with life. Charles had alwayswanted to visit Ocean Park. Now he finally had theopportunity to. He was queuing for the tickets when aman approached him with postcards of Hong Kong andasked if he wanted any. While Charles was scanning thepostcards,another man appeared holding a bunch ofkey chains.Charles looked from one to the other, notknowing what to do. Before Charles knew it, he wassurrounded by three men trying to sell him their goods.He finally managed to fend them off.
Soonï¼ŒCharles reached the ticket counter. Hereached into his jacket pocket for his wallet only torealise that it was missing! He patted all his pocketssearching for it, but it was nowhere to be found.Glancing around anxiously, he could not see his walletanywhere on the ground.Charles thought of the threemen who had accosted him earlier.They had come soclose and had distracted him with their goods. They hadprobably stolen his wallet when he was not payingattention.
To his dismay, Charles never got his wallet backand his trip was spoilt by this appalling incident. It wasreally a bad experience and it taught him to be morecareful in the future.
