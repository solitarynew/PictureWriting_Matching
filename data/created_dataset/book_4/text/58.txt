Jay is my best friend and he comes from a poorfamily. Jay lives in a three-room flat, which is too smallfor a family of five. Although he has to share a roomwith his two siblings, it is cosy and neat.l enjoy going tohis house because it is very cosy.Both his parents areworking but their income is barely enough to supportthe family. We seldom go shopping because Jayreceives very little pocket money. We will usually spendtime in his house because he has to look after hisyounger siblings.
His parents are an affectionate couple and theynever quarrel.They are also very supportive when Jaytakes part in competitions. When Jay performs badly fora test,they will gently encourage him to do betterinstead of scolding him.
l have learnt many things from his family.Mostimportantly, I have learnt that the size of a house doesnot matter as long as the family is happy and contented.A house is empty and meaningless on its own. It is thelove of the family that makes it a home.Jay's house is acastle not because it is big but because it is filled withan abundance of love.
l enjoy being with Jay's family. I have learnt a lotfrom being with them. Now,l seldom quarrel with mysiblings. l treat my siblings the way Jay treats his.
