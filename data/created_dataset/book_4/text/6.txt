Bobo is my sister's birthday present from herboyfriend. It is a chubby,brown coloured puppy. At
first,we were fond of it and loved playing with itfrequently. We even bought a lot of toys and food for it.
However, it's bad habits soon turned us off.
Bobo had a very bad habit ofurinatingeverywhere.Despite training it, it still refused to obeyour instructions. We would unwittingly step on yellowcoloured puddles all over the house whenever wereturned home. Still,we were unwilling to put it in acage as we felt that Bobo should be free to move aboutduring the day.
Howeverï¼ŒBobo's behaviour worsened as thedays went by. lt also started to bite at anything it saw.Once, it bit a hole in my mother's favourite dress.Mymother was so irate that she wanted to send Boboaway. My sister pleaded with her and she reluctantlyagreed to let Bobo stay.However,Bobo did not learn itslesson. The next day,it chewed on my sister's newbranded bag. This time,even my sister was furious.
However,she adored Bobo and was hesitant aboutgiving it away.My sister was in a dilemma about whatto do with Bobo.All of us put our heads together andcame up with a plan.We agreed that Bobo would haveto be in its cage.
Since that day,Bobo has been kept in a cage.It isonly allowed out of the cage if we take it for a walk inthe park. It whined at first, but now it is used to it.
