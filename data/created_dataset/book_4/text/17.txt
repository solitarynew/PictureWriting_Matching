"Yes!"l shrieked and jumped up and down non-stop clapping my hands gleefully."Oh thank you! Thankyou!" l grabbed my father in a bear hug. My fatherlaughed and ruffled my hair. Then, he told me that l hadto help prepare for the celebration.l nodded.My eyeswere gleaming with pride. l would be able to takecharge of my own birthday party! l would be able tohave a barbecue.
On the morning of the barbecue, my friends andl set off early to join in the hustle and bustle at the wetmarket. Usually, we would turn up our noses at walkingthrough the wet market with its filthy and slimy floodand odours.However, we were so thrilled about beingable to select our own food for the barbecue, we didnot mind walking through the place. My father hadgiven me some money,so we had to buy within ourbudget. We were very pleased with ourselves when wemanaged to leave the market with armloads of plasticbags filled with chicken wings, prawns, fish and sweetpotatoes.
Once wearrived home,weimmediatelyprepared the ingredients for the barbecue. We washedand marinated the raw food.My father offered to startthe fire for us. It was not long before we had a blazingfire. When it subsided and the charcoals became redhot,we started the barbecue. We had an enjoyabletime cooking our own food and eating the 'fruits of ourlabour' .
After barbecuing for a few hours, we had alreadyeaten our fill. We ended the party with the cutting ofmy birthday cake. It was the best party l had ever had,though l missed my mother who was working in Sydney.
