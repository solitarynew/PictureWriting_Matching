Jan has a rare medical condition. He perspiresprofusely. Even in air-conditioned rooms where it iscool, beads of perspiration can be seen streaming downhis face. Anything that he touches also gets wetbecause his palms are often sweaty.
Although Jan perspires all the time, on a sultryday, he will perspire even more.Anyone who meets himwill either think that he has been drenched in the rainor someone has splashed a pail of water over him. Hehas to carry a few dry shirts with him wherever he goes.He also makes sure that his clothes are made of amaterial that will absorb his sweat. Unlike his friendswho can wear anything they want,Jan has to be veryselective about his clothes. Wearing lose clothing alsomakes Jan more comfortable.
Initially,Jan was embarrassed by his condition,but he eventually got used to it. When others look athim strangely or ask about the reason for him beingwet,he will give a warm smile and say that his body ison overdrive. Fortunately for him, he does not have abody odour from his perspiration, so he has one lesspotential source of embarrassment to worry about.
Jan's parents intend to take him overseas formedical treatment. Although Jan would like to live anormal life like his other friends, he does not mindstaying the way he is. He has learnt to cope with hissituation. When he starts work, he will probably work inan air-conditioned environment which will prevent himfrom perspiring as much as he does outdoors.
