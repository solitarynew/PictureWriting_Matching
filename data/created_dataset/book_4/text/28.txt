Standing at the front door with a frown on hisface,Mr Tan, our science teacher glared fiercely at us.lmmediately,everyone quietened down. l groanedinwardly. l was hoping he would turn up in a bettermood,but as usual,he was in a foul mood.Marchinginto the room,he slammed our science activity bookson the teacher's table and started yelling our names.lsighed. Mr Tan always reprimanded us. Whatever wedid never pleased him.
As we had three periods of science that day, hetook us to the eco garden for the second part of thelesson.Initially, we were glad because we thought thatit would be more fun out in the garden. However,wewere wrong. While he was talking about one of theplants in the garden, he caught me looking elsewhereand not paying attention to what he was saying. Hepunished not just me, but all my other classmates aswell by making us stand under the blazing hot sun forthe rest of the lesson. We stood there with our handsby our sides, not daring to move.By the time the lessonended,our uniforms，which were sticky with sweat,clung to us uncomfortably.That was the worst lessonwe ever had.
Mr Tan gave us another lecture when wereturned to class.l was indignant about the way he hadpunished us because l had only turned for a second toglance at a butterfly on one of the flowers. However,ldid not dare explain myself as l was worried that Mr Tanwould start reprimanding us again.
Fortunately，Mr Tan was transferred to anotherschool after the June holidays. We were overjoyed thatour authoritarian science teacher was replaced by amore lenient one. We finally began to enjoy our sciencelessons.
