Just like every other morning,Belle awakened tothe singing of the birds. She walked to the window andsaw the lush green grass of the garden below and theclear cloudless blue sky above.
Belle went down to the kitchen to get herbreakfast but was shocked to find it in a mess. Herhelpers were nowhere to be found and the eggs andtoast that were usually placed on the table for her wasgone.All that was left was an empty plate.Just then,Belle heard some noises from the far corner of thekitchen. With a pan in her hand,she crept silentlytowards the noise. She raised the pan and was about tohit at whoever she saw when she spotted a dirty beggareating the scraps off the floors.His knobbly hands werecovered with dirt and his clothes were torn. She feltsorry for him and immediately went to the stove tobring him more food.After wolfing down all the food,he stood up to leave.He thanked her and promised torepay her for her kindness.
lt was two weeks after the beggar's appearancewhen a luxurious coach arrived at her house.Belle waswatering the flowers and she was surprised to see thecoach stop in front of her.The coach door opened anda well-dressed gentleman stepped out gracefully. Shestared at him in puzzlement. He walked towards herand shook her hand. lt was then that she realised thathe was the same filthy beggar she had fed two weeksago.She had almost forgotten about him.
Her greatest surprise came when the coachmanaddressed him as 'your Highness'. Belle was lost forwords. Never did she realise that the dirty beggar eatingfrom her kitchen floor would turn out to be a handsomeand charming prince.He offered to take her for a ride inhis carriage.This was indeed the most pleasant surprisefor her.
