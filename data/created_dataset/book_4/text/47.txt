Since the game show‘Who wants to be amillionaire?’ started screening in Singapore, it has beenthe talk of the town. Everyone will either be talkingabout taking part in the contest to win the top prize of amillion dollars or criticising the contestants for givingthe wrong answers., 
My eldest sister plucked up her courage andapplied to participate in the game.To her surprise, shewas selected as a contestant.My parents and l waited
with a mixture of excitement and worry for the day mysister was supposed to be in the show.
About a month later, she eventually arrived at the'hot seat'. She was jittery at first as she was afraid tomake a fool of herself on television. The whole ofSingapore would know of her idiocy if she left thegame empty-handed. Surprisingly,my sister breezedthrough the questions until she reached a particularlychallenging question. She had to make the decision ofwhether to leave with the thirty-two thousand dollarsshe had won or to take the risk by answering the nextquestion and forgoing part of the money if she gavethe wrong answer. She decided to take the risk.Unfortunately, she got the wrong answer and did notwin the coveted million dollars. However,my sisterwas very contented with winning such a large sum ofmoney.
My sister treated us to a feast with her prizemoney. Seeing how much money my sister had,l wastempted to take part in the game show too.However, lwas too young. l decided to read more books on triviaso that l would be well prepared when l joined thegame show one day.
