"Look at how adorable he is!" Gloria's mothergushed and her father nodded and beamed. Theirattention was focused on Matthew,Gloria's newbrother. He became the centre of attention and Gloriadid not receive as much attention as she used to.Herparents were always cuddling her brother and playingwith him.
She was jealous of her brother for all theattention he was getting. She would scream into his earwhenever he was sleeping peacefully. Sometimes, whenno one was looking, she would pinch him till he cried.She got more rebellious when her parents reproachedher for bullying her brother. Whenever her parentscarried her brother, she would demand to be carriedtoo.
Her jealousy became worse when her brotherbecame more adorable as the days went by andeveryone seemed to dote on him more. Her relativeswere also annoyed with her for her bad behaviour.Herparents were at a loss about how to deal with her.Theytried talking to her countless of times but she refused tolisten.
Gloria's parents were so frustrated that theydecided to send her to a childcare centre.They hopedthat the centre would help to mould her into a betterperson. Surprisingly, Gloria enjoyed going to the centreso much that she soon forgot about her jealousytowards her brother.
