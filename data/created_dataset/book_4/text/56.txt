Last year, my dad was posted to Jakarta for sixmonths to oversee the start-up of his company's newbranch office. As l was still schooling, my mother and lhad to stay in Singapore.We were reluctant to see himgo for we did not want to be separated from him, butmy father had to accept the job in order to advance inhis career.
Two months after he left,riots broke out inJakarta.My mother and l were very worried about myfather's safety, but he assured us that his residentialarea was safe. Still, we were not at ease till his return.Whenever,there was news of trouble in Jakarta,wewould call my dad to check if he was all right.
one gloomy morning, there was a call from theSingapore office. They informed us that a riot hadstarted in the area where my dad was staying and somehouses were broken into and burnt down.They couldnot contact him as his mobile phone was not switchedon and even their staff in the Jakarta office haddispersed and were not contactable.
l did not go to school that day but stayed athome with my mother and waited for news of my dad.we were on edge the entire morning until the call cameat noon.l let out a sigh of relief when l heard my dad'svoice.He had arrived at the airport and was booked onthe next flight out of Jakarta.
He arrived in Singapore that night and we wereoverjoyed and relieved to see him safe and sound again.We were glad when he told us that he did not have toreturn to Jakarta again.
