l stroked China's fur and it wagged its tail.Then,it purred and jumped up onto my lap. l tickled herunder her chin and cuddled her. My kitten is calledChina simply because l found it at Chinatown when lwas there with my mother last month. It was sittingbeside our table at a coffee shop when l first saw it. ltsfur is light grey with dark grey stripes. The most uniquefeature of China is its long striped tail.
l gave it a thorough cleaning when l first broughtit home. lt was very timid and jumpy. The followingday,l took it for a check-up and vaccination. Theveterinarian said that China was healthy and thereshould not be a problem keeping it as a pet. l make surel brush its fur often.China will always snuggle up to me.
Every afternoon when l come home, it will rushto the door to greet me.Unlike my neighbour's cat,China does not like to be alone. ltfollowsmeeverywhere l go and will sit at my feet when l am havingdinner.After dinner, China will appear with a ball in itsmouth,asking me to play with it. lt will fall asleep onmy lap when l watch television. l will then carry it up tomy room where l will tuck it into its basket.
l am glad l brought cute little China home as ithas brought much joy to my family and me. My mother,
who used to detest cats,has even suggested gettingChina a playmate from the animal shelter. We might go
next week. l cannot wait!
