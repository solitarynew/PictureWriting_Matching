There was a contest organised by a localsupermarket to pick contestants to take part in ascavenger hunt. Lucky participants of the hunt couldwin the top price of an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe.However, one had to purchase an item to be eligible forthe contest and the contestants would be pickedthrough a lucky draw.
Mother was captivated by the prize and wouldgrab an item every day from the supermarket. She evenpersuaded her friends and family members to buysomething. Her efforts paid off when she was selectedfor the scavenger hunt. She was ecstatic and began to
dream about going to Europe. It never occurred to herthat she might not win.
On the day of the contest, she set off bright andearly.- lt was held at Sentosa and contestants weresupposed to find several items hidden across the islandusing the clues provided. Together with seven othercontestants,my mother rushed off to win her dreamprize. My mother was confident of winning the hunt asshe knew Sentosa like the back of her hand.
After hunting for the items the entire aay,Mother's dream of going to Europe was dashed. The
other participants were just as familiar with Sentosa asshe was.Moreover, they were much better runners. My
mother was out of breath half way through the huntand she was panting hard by the time she completedthe hunt. Most of the contestants were ahead of her.
She was second last in the race and she only won a fifty-dollar cash voucher.
My mother was greatly disappointed.However, aweek later, she decided to take part in another contestheld by the supermarket. She told me that she mightwin a home theatre system this time.
