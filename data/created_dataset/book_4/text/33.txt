Crimes committed are like jigsaw puzzles wherethere are many pieces of information that are difficultto ascertain and piece together. Detectives themselvesoften do not have all the skills and expertise to solvecrimes.They thus have to rely on forensic scientists tosniff for clues from dead bodies, the scene of the crimeor any other sources, which might shed some light onthe motive of the crime.

scientist is not responsible for solving crimes, his inputprovides detectives with the necessary information theyneed to solve the crimes.
