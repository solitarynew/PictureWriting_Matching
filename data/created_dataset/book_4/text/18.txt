Stomp! Stomp! Puff! Puff! Puff! Every sundown,Atom would jog at the nearby neighbourhood park.Hemade sure he ran at least five rounds even if he waspanting and out of breath. Around him, many people
were also like him, jogging around the track.
After Atom finished jogging, he would make hisway to the field to do some stretching exercises.Heusually spent this time talking to cyclists who went by.As Atom was a familiar figure at the park, he recognisedmany of the other park goers and they often stopped tospeak to him.
one of the park goers that Atom often met wasAnna. She stayed a few blocks away from him and wasabout his age. After bumping into each other a fewtimes,Atom introduced himself and Anna and heagreed to meet up for a jog every evening. With ajogging partner，Atom was spurred on to jog evenmore. He began jogging longer distances with ease.Anna was a great companion who was entertaining totalk too.
Through the conversations，Atom and Annafound out that both of them liked exercising. Theyagreed to meet up more often in the future to exercise.
