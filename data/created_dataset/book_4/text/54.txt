Today,Singapore is blessed with prosperity andstability compared to fifty years ago. We have indeedcome a long way to achieve this success.This successhas been possible with the hard work and perseveranceof our predecessors. Our forefathers had to work veryhard and go through numerous hardships in order toearn a living.
ln the past, many of our forefathers came fromcountries like China and India. Many of those fromChina worked as coolies. Their job was backbreakingand they toiled long hours in the hot sun.
Many of our young today take our presentsuccess for granted.They do not realise that the goodtimes are only temporary and whatever the futurebrings is entirely up to them. We reap what we sow.Diligence will bring good results and sloth will cause thecountry to decline.
Although there are no coolies today,like in thepast, it is important not to slack.Having a good attitudeis the key to success. Whether in school or at work, it isimportant to work hard.
