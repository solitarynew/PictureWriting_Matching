Jerry loves to collect telephone cards.Initially, hecollected only used local telephone cards from hisfriends. He had quite a variety of cards from them
ranging from pictures of animals to pictures of localscenery.
His passion for collecting telephone cards startedwhen he was five years old. He saw a telephone cardthat his mother had discarded.There was a picture of abright and colourful parrot perched on a stick. WhenJerry asked to keep it, his mother showed him anothertwo telephone cards that she had. Jerry was thrilledwhen he saw that each of the cards had vastly differentdesigns.
However, Jerry's mother often rebukes him forhis insane obsession. She was displeased when shefound out that he sometimes rummages among rubbishfor discarded telephone cards.He would pick up thosecards no matter how dirty or old they were.
Jerry's collection also contains cards that arecollector's items.These are unused cards and some areinternational calling cards. Whenever his parents traveloverseas,they will buy these cards for him.Jerry hasseparate albums for his cards. He separates the localcards from the international cards as well as thecommon ones from the rarer more valuable ones.
Jerry hopes to increase his collection in the yearsto come. He has also discovered that it is possible totrade telephone cards with other collectors online. Hecannot wait to start doing that at the end of the yearafter his examinations are over.
