When it is a fine, warm or sunny day, the streetand shops along Orchard Road will be packed witlpeople. However , on a rainy day, the number of peopldwalking along this popular road will decline. Insteadmany will be taking shelter in the buildings.
Whenever it rains, l will see many people holdingon to their umbrellas or raincoats walking briskly fromone building to another. Pedestrians will not wait fonmy green sign but will just dash across the road. Somewill run to take shelter at the bus stop while others wilwait by the buildings for the callous rain to stop. Shopsselling umbrellas will take advantage of the awfulweather to increase their sales.
l wished l could be like those walking humans. ltis definitely not fun to be positioned at the same spotespecially on such nasty days. Feeling the rain beatdown so hard on me, yet not being able to do anything.Sometimes,l feel so miserable that l feel like switchingmyself off. However,l never do that because l knowthat once l stop working there might be accidents onthe road as motorists and pedestrians will all want tohave their way.
Still, l often feel down because nobody seems toappreciate me. Besides pedestrians,even drivers hateme and complain that l waste their precious time. Noone knows how important it is for me to be therewhether rain or shine,contributing quietly to the lawand order of this busy commercial district.
