During the June holidays, my teachers organiseda camping trip to Pulau Ubin for the Primary Fourpupils. We were excited about the trip because it wasthe first time we were going camping.
when we arrived at the campsite,we quicklyset up our tents,as a thunderstorm was imminent.Although we were all novices,we successfully set upthe tents. Everyone crawled inside when we heardrumbling in the sky.We were just in time.Huge dropletsof rain splattered so heavily on our tents that we felt asthough there were a dozen people pounding their fistsfrom outside. Many of us cowered in the dark tents,hoping that the rain would stop soon.
lt rained the entire afternoon that day and wewere forced to stay in our tents. Our teacherscommunicated their instructions to us using loud hailersso that we did not have to leave our tents.Everyone feltmiserable and no one had any appetite for dinner thatnight. We all slept earlyï¼Œhoping that it would be abetter day the next day.However,little did we knowthat things would worsen.
Although we were protected from the rain,wecould not escape from the onslaught of mosquitoes.They were buzzing all around our campsite that nightand many of us were bitten badly despite the largeamounts of insect repellent we used. lt was indeed amiserable night for us.
The next morning, all of us were busy comparingthe number of mosquito bites on our bodies.Everyonewas miserable.The ground was muddy and once westepped out, our shoes were caked with mud.Everyonefelt down.
