The bell had finally rung for recess. Everyonestarted streaming out of the classes excitedly. Somemade a beeline for the canteen while others went tothe field to play.Anthony and his group of friends wentto a quiet corner in the school for their usual activity -solving riddles.
This had been going on for the past half a year.They would buy a quick snack to satisfy their hungerbefore proceeding to their activity. Once the five ofthem in the group had settled down, they would begintheir riddle time. Everyone prepared their own riddlesfor the group or an individual to solve, and those whogot the answer correct would be able to pose questionsof their own.They enjoyed guessing the riddles becauseof their eagerness to show off their own ingenuity andcreativity to their friends.
Once a riddle was posed,there was often asilence among the group as everyone stopped toponder. No one wanted to come up with a foolishanswer. Anthony was often the one who managed tosolve most of the riddles. When Anthony was notaround, many of the riddles often went unsolved.
Anthony and his group treated this activityseriously and they would not allow any new members inunless he was able to solve their difficult riddles andcome up with one of his own. Up till today, nobody hasbeen successful and there are no new members in thegroup.Anthony and his friends look forward to recessevery day. Each day, they try to come up with the bestriddle that will impress everyone else in the group.
