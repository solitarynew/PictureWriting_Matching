After the first term testï¼ŒJudith went on anexcursion to the television station with her classmates.They were welcomed by a guide who took them on atour around the place. After strict instructions weregiven to stay together as a group in the station, the tourbegan.
First,they visited the room where all thecostumes were kept. They were introduced to a widevariety of costumes from different historical periods.Some were elaborate while others were very simple.Judith liked the period costumes best as they wereintricately embroidered with colourful pictures offlowers,phoenixesand dragons. Each of thesecostumes was elegant and unique.
There were also all kinds of stage props used.Judith was fingering the swords and cups used in perioddramas when she came face to face with a skull.She gotsuch a shock that she screamed and backed away. Herclassmates laughed at her and one of them evenpounced on her to scare her.Judith was also frightenedby the many wigs that she saw there.She preferred thecostumes to the props.
After that,they proceeded to tour a studiowhere all the recordings were done.On the way there,they came across some stars.There was bedlam as thestar-struck group chased after the stars for autographsand pictures. The instructions given earlier wereinstantly forgotten and the guide and the teachers hada hard time getting the group back again.
lt was a rewarding and entertaining trip.Judithhad never had so much fun.Attracted to what she sawand learnt at the studio, Judith decided to be an actresswhen she grew up.
