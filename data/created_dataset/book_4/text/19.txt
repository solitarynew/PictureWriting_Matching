My father has a career which not many peoplehave. He is a meteorologist. His job is to track the
weather patterns and to give a weather forecast to
people like pilots and sailors who depend heavily on theconditions of the weather.
~. He works in an office that has many complexesand technologically advanced machinery to help him.
He has access to satellite images to help him identifyany oncoming storms or weather-related disasters likehurricanes. In addition to computers,he uses other
manual instruments like the weather balloon and thewind vane to track the weather.
Although pilots and sailors have never met myfather, my father knows that his job is crucial for themto do their work. When pilots hear that a thunderstorm
is approaching, they might choose to make a detour or
even not to take off. During bad weather, sailors mightchoose not to sail as well in case their ships capsize.
Although he is often busy at work,his job doesnot require him to bring any work home.He is thus able
to spend much quality time with us and tell us storiesabout meteorology. l am so inspired by what he doesthat my ambition is to become a meteorologist toowhen l grow up.
