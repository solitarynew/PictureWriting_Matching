"Yummy!" l clapped my hands in delight at thespread of food before me. Singapore is a food paradise.You can find food centres almost everywhere and theyoffer all kinds of international cuisine.Therefore, mostSingaporeans will naturally prefer to eat out. However,l enjoy eating at home instead.
My mother is a remarkable cook.I always teaseher about opening a training school to teach the topchefs how to cook.Her dishes are not only delectablebut also very pleasing to the eye. Once she startscooking, the aroma from her dishes makes my mouthwater.
Ever since l was a child, l remember alwayswatching my mother cook in the kitchen. She likestrying new dishes. She is very innovative in her
experiments. She never admits defeat when her newdishes do not turn out right. She will continue topersevere till she succeeds. My father and l alwayssupport her and will try any new dishes that she puts onthe table. Even when her dishes do not turn out well,we will still eat them because we want to encourageher to continue cooking.
My family always enjoys having dinner at homebecause we have a great chef who knows what we liketo eat and caters to our preferences.Moreover, we getto try authentic home-cooked dishes without jostlingwith the crowds at eating places every day.
