l pulled on my diving suit and pushed my feetinto the flippers.Then l put the goggles firmly in placeand adjusted the mouthpiece.It was my first time scubadiving. l had heard my instructor telling us stories aboutspotting various marine creatures while diving in theopen sea. My favourite story was the one aboutspotting a Manta Ray flying majestically through thewater.
After diving for three days, l had yet to see anyManta Rays. All l saw were corals and dull lookingfishes swimming around. l was prepared to go homedisenchanted as l entered the water for my last dive.After all, it was rare to spot a Manta Ray, since it was anelusive creature.
After diving for almost half an hour, a shadowpassed overhead.When l turned to look, l was surprisedto see a Manta Ray gliding just beneath the surface ofthe water. It was indeed an awesome sight looking atthe Manta Ray gliding effortlessly through the waterwith its wings spread out widely. For a fleeting moment,l wondered what it would be like to ride on the mantaray.
l was not the only lucky one to spot the MantaRay.The whole boat of divers saw it too. It was thetopic of the day as everyone talked excitedly about thesighting.
