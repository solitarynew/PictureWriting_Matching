Eric was our class clown who liked to do sillythings to make everyone laugh. Whenever the teacher
was not looking, he would either make inane facesbehind her back or draw comical cartoons. Sometimes,we could not control ourselves and we would burst outlaughing, much to our teacher's annoyance.
One day, Eric was up to his usual antics.He creptup to the teacher's desk and placed a life-like rubberspider on it.Unfortunately for our teacher, she was latethat day and rushed into class without noticing thespider. She placed her hands on it while talking to us.When she saw the spider, she gave a shriek and threwthe spider into the air. We were unable to controlourselves and laughed our heads off.
To our surprise,she laughed along with us.Wewere expecting to be punished because of Eric's zanypranks, but she just urged us not to do it again.
Eric was certainly an interesting character. Henever failed to perk up a boring lesson.Luckily for him,his cherubic face always got him out of trouble.Indeed,the class would not be fun and lively without Eric's zanydeeds.
