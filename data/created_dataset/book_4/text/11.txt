Jennifer's favourite pastime is lazing on thecouch to watch television programmes or movies. She iscertainly a couch potato.As she comes from a well-to-do family, she has two maids to wait on her. When sheis watching television, she does not have to lift a fingerto take anything as her maids give her whatever shewants.
Every day after school, she will have her lunch inthe living room so that she can watch televisionsimultaneously. She does not even bother to changeout of her school uniform. Once on the couch, she willleave it only when she needs to go to the toilet. Hermaids will serve her lunch, drinks, and snacks.They willalso clear the dishes when she has finished eating.

Her maidwill also put the DvD into the player for her.Jenniferdoes not even have to leave the couch. She can spendentire afternoons slouched in front of the television.Even when her eyes get blurry from watching shows fora long time, she will not stop.
Jennifer's favourite pastime has caused herweight to balloon to eighty kilograms. She is obesebecause she lacks exercise and snacks continuouslywhen she is watching television.
However, Jennifer is not motivated to change herways. Although she was slightly alarmed when she lastweighed herselfï¼Œher weight did not deter her fromcontinuing with her ways. She is always telling herselfthat one day she will stop watching so much television,but for now, there are just too many interesting showsfor her to stop.
