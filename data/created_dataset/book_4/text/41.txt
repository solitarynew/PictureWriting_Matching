“Your mum and l often spent our Saturday nightswatching films in our car. We would park our cars in a
huge field and watch a movie on a big screen withothers who were in their cars too," my father told meone afternoon. My eyes widened in surprise.The onlycinemas l had ever gone to were indoor air-conditionedones.I had never heard of an open-air cinema.Afterlistening to their stories, l yearned to go to an open-aircinema as well.
My wish finally came true when the local radiostation organised an open-air event at Fort CanningPark. It was the perfect opportunity to watch a filmin an open-air cinema. When l told my father，heimmediately agreed. The event would allow him toreminisce about the times he went out with my mother.
When we arrived at the 'cinema' , we managed tosecure a strategic spot where we could get the bestview.My parents laid the mat and l helped to take outthe food that we had brought along. We settled downcomfortably and l waited eagerly for the film to start.Although it was a humid night, l enjoyed the show very
much. l was astounded by how well the souna ana riimquality were.They were as good as any conventional
cinema. We munched on our food as we watched themovie. It was fun to watch it under the stars. lt reallyfelt like what my parents had described it to be.
Although l watched other films at the usualcinemas after that, they were never as enjoyable as thefilm l watched outdoors that day. l could not wait forthe opportunity to watch another film outdoors.
