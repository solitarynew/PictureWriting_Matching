My favourite subject in school is Science.Ourscience teacher is very inspiring and dedicated to hiswork.He always finds ways to motivate us to work veryhard for the subject and score well for tests andexaminations. He has enhanced my interest in scienceand l want to be a scientist in the future.
During my free time,l will read up on booksrelated to Science and surf the Internet for Sciencerelated subjects. l have found a host of experimentsthat l can conduct at home with everyday householditems.l often dream of myself in a white coat pouringliquids in beakers in a laboratory.
Due to my interest in science,my parents andrelatives always buy me science-related toys.My unclebought me a telescope, my grandparents bought me achemistry set and my parents bought me a microscope.Recently, l started making my own specimens.l growmould on bread and place them on slides.Then l look atthe mould in detail through my magnifying glass.In thisway, I gain a lot more knowledge than what l can find inmy textbook.
l hope to do well in my studies.In time to come,lhope to be a famous scientist and make the world abetter place to live in.
