lt was the worst holiday I had ever had.Two daysbefore the school holidays, l had a bad fall while playingbasketball and l fractured my leg. When the doctorannounced that it would take three to four weeks formy leg to recover,I knew that ! was going to have adreadful vacation.
As expected, the pain was unbearable the firstweek, so l was bedridden the whole time.At first, I triedto keep myself entertained by watching televisionprogrammes and home videos. l was glad that l did nothave to do any household chores or homework.I wasserved hand and foot by my mother.
However, I was bored to tears by the third dayand started to grumble about everything. My motherwas infuriated with my grumbling. She tried to pacifyme with a new computer game. However,even thatattempt to silence me was futile,as l completed thegame within a week and my complaints resumed.
l was only able to walk normally three daysbefore the new school term began.l promised myself tobe more careful in future.
