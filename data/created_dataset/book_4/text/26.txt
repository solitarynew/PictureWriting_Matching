My younger brother，Arthur,is only five yearsold. He has a chubby little face and his large roundeyes light up whenever he smiles. Arthur's actions arecomical and adorable.Although he may look innocent,sometimes he can be very mischievous.
There was one incident that happened to Arthur,which earned him the title ‘The funniest person athome'. lt was during the Lunar New Year celebrationsand all our relatives were visiting our family. Arthurliked to help my Mother serve drinks and titbits to ourguests. Whenever he served our guests drinks,hewould scrunch up his face and impersonate a famousmovie star. However,he was sometimes unsuccessfuland in his eagerness to make a funny face, he wouldunknowingly spill some drinks on himself. After realisinghis folly, he would make a pathetic looking face thatwould evoke laughter and win the sympathy of ourguests.
After that incident,Arthur polished up hisimpersonating skills. He also thought of other ways tomake people laugh as he loved being the centre ofattention.
l adore Arthur and l enjoy seeing how comical hecan be. After a hard day at school,l certainly liven upwhen l see Arthur.
