When we were having our vacation in Hawaii lastyear,my father suggested going scuba diving. We hadheard numerous interesting stories about diving andswimming underwater among the fishes and beautifulcorals. We wanted to find out first-hand what it wouldbe like moving about with the marine creatures around
us.
After going through a short briefing andfamiliarisation course with the equipment,we were
ready to dive into the clear blue waters.Initially, we feltnervous about the new environment. However,once
we entered,there was a multitude of creaturesswimming about and each one was more beautiful thanthe next. We were so engrossed in the beautiful marinecreatures that we forgot all about our fears.l stayed at
the spot where the coral reefs were for a long timewatching the colourful reefs swaying about in thewater.
The most fascinating creature we saw was thesea worm. As the name implies,it looked like a wormand lived on the seabed. We observed its behaviour forquite some time and were intrigued by it. It escaped
from its predators by hiding inside the sand,butunfortunately for themï¼Œtheir predators sometimes
outsmarted them.The sea worm that we saw blendedin well with the sand, so it was hard to spot it.lt glidedslowly along the seabed, sometimes disappearing underit.
After observing these creatures underwater, wereturned to the surface as we were running out of air. Itwas fun learning about such creatures, especially thesea worm.This was an experience l would not be ableto have in a classroom.
