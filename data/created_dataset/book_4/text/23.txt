“Hey,you guys!" Seng called out to everyone."Did you know that we have a surprise Maths testtoday? I heard about it from Mandy!"
"You've got to be joking!"Keng exclaimed inhorror."What Maths test are you talking about?Nobody told me about any Maths test!"
“It can't be true. Miss Teo didn't mention itbefore," Peter the class monitor insisted."If there was, lwould have been the first one to know! Miss Teo alwaystells me things."
"What kind of things? So you are now theteacher's pet?" Keng commented sarcastically.
"Its true. If she had told you, it would not becalled a surprise test!" Seng said confidently.
Just then, the bell rang for the next lesson andMiss Teo came to class promptly.The lesson proceededwithout any test being conducted and no one dared tomention it, thinking that she must have forgotten aboutit. Even Peter did not dare breathe a word to her.
After the lesson ended,everyone gave Seng acold stare,but Seng was trying hard to control hislaughter. They realised that Seng had just played anApril Fool's joke on them.
