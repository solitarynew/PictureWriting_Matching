When l was six months old,my parents werekilled in a car accident. As there was nobody to takecare of me, l was brought up in an orphanage managedby a group of nuns.
One sunlit morning,l was playing at theplayground with the other children when a couple,Mrand Mrs Robinson,arrived in a chic new car. At fiveyears old, l was oblivious to the commotion around me.The older children who knew the purpose of thecouple's visit were very excited.
Mr and Mrs Robinson were here to adopt a child.After having a look at all the children, they decided toadopt me. Initially,I was apprehensive of leaving theorphanage and my dear friends behind. However, thecaring couple were very reassuring and l was showeredwith love from the first day. l was lucky to have found aloving and caring family.
The day l was adopted by the Robinsons was thehappiest day of my life. It was also the beginning of anew life for me.
