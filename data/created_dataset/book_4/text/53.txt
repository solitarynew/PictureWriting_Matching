"Oh no! How am l going to explain why l got suchbad results?" groaned Peter. He stared at the long rowof bright red crosses on the paper and the horrible â€˜22'at the top right hand corner.He had failed his Mathstest again.His teacher was convinced that he had notstudied hard enough and said that he was incorrigible.
That night, Peter had a long talk with his parents.They told him that they could not afford to get him atutor,so he had to study on his own. Peter wasdetermined not to disappoint his parents.He was surethat he would be able to make it on his own. Peterdecided to sacrifice the time he spent on the computerand the daily soccer games. With all his hard work,Peter was certain that success was in the bag.He knewthat he would do well for the next Maths test.
Peter was right. He passed with flying coloursand even topped the class.His parents were very proudof him. They told him that they were glad that he didnot get dejected with his bad results and throw in thetowel.
Peter decided to cut down on his leisure timeand put in more effort in his studies.The results werecertainly worth it.
