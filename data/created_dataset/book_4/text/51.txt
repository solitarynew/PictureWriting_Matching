My father jumped up and waved the paper in hishand. Suddenly, he ran towards me and lifted me up. l
shrieked when he twirled me around and around.Finally, he put me down and beamed at me. l stared athim in bewilderment. He beamed and showed me theslip of paper he was holding. "I won the lottery!" he
screamed.To celebrate his win,he decided to take mymother and me to a French restaurant.
When we arrived at the restaurant,we weregreeted warmly and shown to our seats. We werestruck by the grandeur of the place.The restaurant wasdimly lit and there was a lamp on every table. Everyonewas talking softly and soothing music was playing in thebackground.There was a starched white tablecloth oneach table, gleaming silverware and shiny wineglasses.There were also different types of cutlery meant for thedifferent courses neatly laid out on either side of eachplate.
After taking our seats, the waiter presented myfather with a wine list. He ordered the best bottleof wine from the selection. As we were unsure ofwhat to orderï¼Œthe waiter patiently gave somerecommendations. We finally decided on a four-courseset-dinner.
lt was the most scrumptious dinner l had evereaten. I felt like l was an aristocrat and wished that wecould eat there every week.
