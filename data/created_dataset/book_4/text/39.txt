During a vacation in Hawaii with my parents,lcame across an indigenous person who was pickinglitter along the shore at the beach. Sometimes hewaded in the water to pick up things like cans andwooden crates floating by. l observed him for a while.Then，overcome by curiosity，I went up to him andasked him if he was a beachcomber.
Taken aback by my question,he paused andreplied,"Yes,l am a beachcomber. How may l helpyou?"
“oh，'m just curious," l replied.“l was justsurprised and thrilled that l could finally meet abeachcomber. You see, my teacher told us about whatbeachcombers do, and since we didn't have any, wherel live,l am just excited that l could finally meet one,"lexplained."My teacher also told us that beachcombershelp to keep the shores clean and help the environmentby recycling what sailors would throw away from theirships."
The man nodded and smiled.He opened his sackand showed me what he had collected. They weremostly empty cans.l was about to ask him more aboutwhat he did when my parents called out to me. Smilingand waving at the beachcomber, l walked towards myparents.
My parents glanced back at the man inamusement when l told them who he was.Just before lleft the beach,l turned to take a last look at thebeachcomber. He was resting under a shady tree,fanning himself. He had a smile on his face. He musthave been pleased with what he had collected.
