One of my childhood hobbies was catchingspiders.l was introduced to this unusual hobby whenmy classmate brought his fighting spider to school tofight with other spiders.I begged him to tell me moreabout his hobby. Before long, l became adept atcatching spiders as well as caring for this arachnid.
Every Saturday afternoon,with my parents'permission,l went to MacRitchie Reservoir with myfriends to catch spiders among the bushes in thecatchment area.Although there were many mosquitoesflying around, we usually managed to tolerate the bitesas well as other insects for the sake of catching themost potent spiders living there. l would swell withpride whenever l successfully caught one because thespiders were rather elusive.
After placing the spiders in containers, we wouldreturn home to 'trainâ€™ the spiders to become ferociousand strong. When our spiders were ready,we wouldhave a match. We had matches almost every day.
However, my parents were not very pleased withmy hobby.They did not like having so many spiders inthe house.To appease them,l promised to study hardfor my examinations and l also made sure that thespiders would not escape from the container.
