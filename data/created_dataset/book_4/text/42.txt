My grandfather stopped abruptly.Turning andpointing to his left, he jumped up and down excitedly.lbacked away and stared at my grandfather. Squinting atthe house on the right, l burst out laughing. There was agarage sale. My grandfather loved garage sales.
We immediately made our way to the house.There, we came across many antiques on sale as wellas other attention-grabbing things. The item thatcaptivated my grandfather the most was an old but stillworkable gramophone.My grandfather bargained withthe owner over the price and he finally paid twohundred dollars for it.
My grandfather was red with excitement.Insteadof shuffling his feet like he usually did, he walked homeso briskly that l could hardly catch up with him.On theway, he told me that the gramophone reminded him ofhis younger days.Back then, he would entertain himselflistening to songs on a gramophone that belonged to hisfather. Howeverï¼Œmy grandfather was forced to sellthe gramophone when his business ran into financialdifficulties.
When the gramophone was cleaned up properly,my grandfather took out some of his old records totry the player. It worked marvellously and his facebrightened up. His happiest memories had come aliveagain after so many years.
That night,my parents and l did not watchtelevision like we usually did as my grandfather waslistening to his favourite tunes on the gramophone.l was glad that my grandfather had found thegramophone.
