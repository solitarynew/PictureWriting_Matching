Ting! Ting! Ting! whirr! My favourite varietyshow was on. It was the 'Wheel of Fortune'. lt wasshown on television every weekday from 6 to 6.30pm.lsettled down in front of the television and for the nexthalf an hour, l was engrossed in the show.
Every day,there were three contestants whowould take turns to solve the word puzzles. Beforemaking a guess, the contestants would spin a glitterywheel with numerous coloured pieces on it. Dependingon where the wheel stopped,the contestant had achance of winning several hundred dollars to overseastrips.A contestant could select a letter that would helphim to solve the puzzle.If the contestant failed, it wouldbe the other contestant's turn.
l felt that the show was intellectually stimulating
as l tried to solve the puzzles aong ward tecontestants.l was delighted whenever l managed to
solve the puzzle before the contestant did. l would jumpup and down on the sofa and tap my feet impatientlywhenever the contestant could not figure out a simplepuzzle.
l wrote to the television station once to ask if itwas possible to bring the â€˜Wheel of Fortune'toSingapore. However,l did not receive a reply fromthem.l continued to watch the show, hoping to becomeso proficient that l would be an expert at the game if itwas ever brought to Singapore.
