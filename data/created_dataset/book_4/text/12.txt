Aunt Yanny gave me two russet colouredhamsters for my birthday.They were like two tiny furballs that were about the size of my palm. My favouritepastime was playing with them.I named them Amy andMinny. l preferred Minny because it was much tamerand more adorable than Amy.
Every day, the first thing l would do after cominghome from school was to take a good look at themwhile they were sleeping peacefully in their cages.Afterdinner, l would take them out of their cage and let themrun around on the sofa. l enjoyed watching them climbup and down the cushions searching for hiding places,like explorers.However, I always kept an eye on themand made sure that they did not wander too far. Once,Amy had scurried under the sofa when l was notlooking and l spent the entire night searching for her.Even after l found her, l had to use food to lure her out.lt was very tedious,so after that, l kept an eye on herwhenever she was out of her cage.
They loved grooming themselves regularly,especially after they returned to their cages. I wouldspend my Saturday afternoons bathing them with soapand water and cleaning their cages. After their bath, lwould give them treats like Vitamin C drops which werespecially for hamsters.
l enjoyed having these two hamsters so muchthat l asked my mother if ! could buy two more.However, she was adamant about not having any morepets in the house.Although l was disappointed, l did notmind, as l already had two adorable hamsters.
