lt was my grandmother's sixtieth birthday and
we were going to have a grand celebration at home.Mymother and aunts were preparing a great feast for thecelebration. With the massive amount of cooking beingdone,there was a lot of cooked and uncooked foodstrewn around the kitchen.
After cooking most of the dishes,the chefsdecided to take a break. They had been workingcontinuously since five in the morning. They decided tohave some coffee at cafe nearby. They left the housewithout bothering to tidy up the place or cover thefood.
After their break,they felt refreshed andproceeded to return home to continue with thecooking.To their horror, they saw a huge colony of antsattacking the food left uncovered on the table.Therewere tiny black dots moving on the table,on thebottles,around the rims of the bowls and in the fooditself. It was impossible to touch something without anant crawling out of it. In their hurry to enjoy theircoffee, my mother and aunts had forgotten to wrap upthe food and store them in the refrigerator. Theyrushed to kill the ants with their bare hands, as they didnot want to contaminate the food with insecticide.
After an uphill battle with the ants,most ofthe food was unfit for consumption. They weredisappointed as all their efforts were wasted.They hadno choice but to suggest that everyone eat at arestaurant instead. What a disappointment everyonehad.
