Mr and Mrs Shimazu were first-time tourists inSingapore.On one of their sightseeing trips, they cameacross a trishaw rider along the street. They had always
wanted to ride in a trishaw.They were thrilled when thetrishaw rider could communicate in Japanese. Theyhopped onto the trishaw gleefully.They were so eagerto take the ride that they did not bother to ask aboutthe fare.
The trishaw rider was a brainy and experiencedguide cum rider who took the couple to see manywonderful sights that could not be found on the mapand were not on their itinerary.He even took them toplaces where they could savour authentic local food.The couple was very impressed with the rider's highstandard of service and knowledge.
when the ride came to an end, the trishaw riderasked for two hundred dollars for the ride. MrShimazu's jaw dropped when he heard the fare, but hewas so pleased with the ride that he agreed to pay therider what he asked for. What the couple did not realisewas that they were cheated for this ridiculously deartrishaw ride.
The rider waved and rode away, whistling loudly.He had made more than he had in the past week.Hewished he could meet more tourists like them.
