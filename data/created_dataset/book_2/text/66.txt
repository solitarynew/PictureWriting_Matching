There is a market near my flat in Yishun. Unlike an air-conditioned supermarket, the market is very hot. The place reeks of the smell of fish. The floor is also wet and slippery. However, many residents go there to buy food. There are many types of meat, vegetables and fruit there.
My mother and I go to the wet market every Sunday. She says that the food there is cheap and fresh. She likes shopping there because she can bargain for a lower price with the stallholders. Sometimes, they do not give in to her. She will walk away. They always agree to a lower price after that. My mother always wins in the end. I will chuckle whenever my mother gets the price that she wants.
Although I do not like the smell of the market, I enjoy going there with my mother. I took forward to Sunday mornings at the market every week.
