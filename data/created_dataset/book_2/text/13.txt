There was a dress-up day at school after the examinations last month. My classmates and I went to school dressed up as what we wanted to be.  My best friend, Kyle, wanted to be an astronaut.  Many of my classmates wanted to be doctors or teachers. I was different. I wanted to be a comedian.
That day, I told my teachers and friends what I would do if I were a comedian. I would make people laugh. I told my friends and teachers jokes. They burst out laughing. Everyone praised me and said that I would be a good comedian next time. I told everyone that I liked watching a famous local Chinese comedian.  He was my idol. I wanted to be like him.
I was glad that my friends and teachers thought that I would be a good comedian.I hoped to learn more jokes and tell them to my friends so that I could make them laugh.
