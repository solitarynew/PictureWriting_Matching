I have a brother who is a year younger than l am. We look very different. I am tall and thin but he is short and fat. I have straight hair but he has curly hair.
We are poles apart. I have a soft voice but he has a loud voice. love to wake up early but he loves to sleep late. I have many good friends but he has a lot of enemies. All my classmates like me becausel am always cheerful and helpful. All his classmates dislike him because he is always playing tricks on them. He always scares the girls in his class.They detest his tricks.
All the people who know us always comment on how different we are. Although we are very different, I love my brother very much.
