Every morning, Jordan wakes up at dawn to get ready for school. He always feels sleepy in the morning but he makes sure that he gets up on time so that he will not be late. He brushes his teeth and washes his face. Then, he showers and puts on his school uniform.
Jordan combs his hair neatly before he sits down for breakfast. He always drinks a cup of hot chocolate and eats two pieces of toast with strawberry jam.
After breakfast, Jordan puts on his clean white socks and shoes. He gives his mother a hug before he leaves the house. He takes a lift to the void deck and waits for his school bus. By then, he is alert and ready to start the school day.
