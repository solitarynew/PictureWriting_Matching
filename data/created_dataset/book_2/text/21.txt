I have tried many sports. I like swimming the most. I enjoy swimming in both the sea and the pool.
I go swimming in the pool near where I stay. I can swim many laps. I know both the butterfly stroke and the breaststroke. Swimming is a vigorous activity. I am exhausted after each swim but l always feel great. After a swim, I wrap myself with a towel so that I will not feel cold.
I wish to be a swimming coach when l grow up. l want to teach everyone how to swim so that they can enjoy swimming.
