Harry, the hare, was afamous sprinter in Forever Forest. He liked to challenge the other forest animals but none of them wanted to race with him. They were not confident of winning.
One day, Tony, the tortoise, was munching on a delicious leaf when he saw Harry. He said, "Ill race with you."
Harry rolled about with laughter, â€œYou?" He could not believe how silly Tony was.
Tony was not afraid of Harry.  He was willing to race with Harry. He was not afraid of losing. He would just try his best. They agreed to race the next day.
