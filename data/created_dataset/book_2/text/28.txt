Chinese New Year is just round the corner. My mother will bake many different kinds of cookies for our relatives. She is just like a professional baker.
My father will re-paint the whole house. It is tiring but he enjoys doing it. Even though he is tired, he does not want anyone else to help him. He says that we will not be able to do a good job. My sister and I will help to clean the house. We make sure that the place is spick and span for the new year.
This year, my sister and I will help our mother with the baking because we want to learn some baking skills from her. My mother is looking forward to that. She says that if we help her, she can bake even more cookies. All of us will be busy preparing for this special occasion.
