There are many shops in my neighbourhood. The place I like most is the comic shop. This shop has been here for more than five years. Itis found along a row of shophouses.
Comics line the shelves in this shop. There are both Chinese and English comics.  Most of them are imported from other countries. Some of the comics are rare. They cannot be found in other comic shops.These special edition comics are very expensive but my mother lets me buy them.
I am a collector of interesting comic books. I already have a large collection at home but there are always new comic books to buy. I am glad that there is such a shop near my house.
