Ken is an orphan. His parents passed away when he was a baby. He stays with his uncle at a farmhouse in Malaysia. He likes staying there because he can see the farm animals.
There are cows, horses, ducks, goats and sheep on the farm. Ken helps his uncle to take care of the animals. He feeds the cows and pigs. He collects eggs from the chicken coop every morning. Sometimes, Ken talks to the roosters, hens and chicks. Other times, he plays with the dog and its puppies. Besides the animals, he also loves the scenery at the farm. He spends his afternoons lying on the grass and staring at the fluffy white clouds.
However, Ken does not want to be a farmer like his uncle. He prefers to go to school. He hopes to go to a school in the city next year.
