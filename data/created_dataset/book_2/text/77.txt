I like to eat all kinds of vegetables. My family members are vegetarians. Vegetables are not only cheap but also good for our health.
I love to eat kailan. It is green and white in colour. It contains calcium and iron. It keeps my bones strong. My mother fries it and pours oyster sauce on it. Sometimes, she boils it. Cauliflower is yellowish white. It is rich in vitamin C, just like oranges. I like it when my mother cooks it with mushrooms. Many people do not like to eat cauliflower, but I like its taste. Brinjal is usually purple. l am the only one in my family who likes this. My other family members do not like the taste of brinjal. also like kangkong, green beans and asparagus. Il enjoy eating them fried with just soya sauce.
There is such a wide variety of vegetables thatI never get tired of eating them. Although they are all vegetables, they have different tastes. Some are slightly sweet, while some are a little bitter. I look forward to a new vegetable dish almost every night.
