I went to the library with my mum last Saturday for the first time.It was fascinating. I had never seen so many books before.
When we reached there, my mum took me to the children's section where I feasted my eyes on the many titles they had on the shelves.I took out a few books and took them to the reading corner. I settled down comfortably on a chair and began reading. I was so engrossed in the books that I did not realise that I had been sitting there for half an hour. My mum told me that it was time to go.
My mum asked me if I wanted to borrow any books. I nodded eagerly. I chose a few books and we went to the borrowing machine. She used her library card to borrow four books for me to read. She encouraged me to read more books.
