Flora and Fiona are twins. They look identical. They like to wear the same clothes. It is hard to tell them apart. Even their parents mix them up sometimes.
They are also alike in many ways. Flora is a polite girl. Fiona is also a courteous girl. They have a lot of friends because everybody likes them. The girls are also very kind. They always help their old neighbour, Mrs Tan. She relies on them to help her to cross roads.
Sometimes, the girls wear different clothes when they go out. It is easy to tell them apart in this way. Flora likes to wear light coloured clothes while Fiona prefers dark coloured clothes. On weekends, the twins usually wear different clothes when they go out with their parents.
