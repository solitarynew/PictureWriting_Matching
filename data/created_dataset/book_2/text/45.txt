If I were a fly, I would fly around every day with my friends and relatives. We would go everywhere.We would visit the rubbish bins, eating outlets and even parks.
My favourite place would be the eating outlets, especially food centers. I would hover over people's food and land on them when no one is looking. I must be careful and not let them notice me.lf they see me, they will swipe at me with their hands. Some people are so angry when they see us that they will chase us everywhere.  Why can't they leave us alone? We just need a little food to survive.
lIf I were a fly, I hope I never get crushed by a person's hands. This is because I will not be able to fight back. I will be killed immediately.
