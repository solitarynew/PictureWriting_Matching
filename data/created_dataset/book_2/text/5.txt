There are five members in my family - my parents, older sister, younger brother and me. My sister is nine years older than l am and my brother is only one year younger than I am.
My father is a civil engineer in the public sector. Sometimes, he has to travel overseas for work. Usually, he travels to the neighbouring countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Most of the time, he is in Singapore. When he is not busy, he will pick my mother up after work.  My mother works as a senior nurse at Changi Hospital. She is a kind and patient lady. She takes good care of her patients.
My older sister is in a local university. She studies very hard. She hopes to be an architect one day. My younger brother and I are in the same school. I take care of him in school. l love my family very much.
