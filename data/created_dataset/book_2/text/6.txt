Mr Nib is my English teacher. He always wears a pair of glasses during lessons. He is about forty years old but he still looks quite young.
He often wears a white shirt and a pair of brown trousers. Some mischievous pupils called him 'Mr Neat'. He always arranges his stationery very neatly in front of him on his table. He is also very concerned about the way we do our work. He always tells us to write neatly. He also likes to tell us jokes.  We always burst out laughing whenever we hear his jokes. Mr Nib will tell us a joke whenever we finish our work on time.
When we are rowdy, he never gets angry. He will tell us firmly to keep quiet. He will give us gold stars whenever we are well-behaved, so many of us will want to get as many gold stars as we can.
