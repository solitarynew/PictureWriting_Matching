Two scuba divers dived into the sea. They wore their wet suits and flippers on their feet. Each of them had a snorkel as well. It was connected to the oxygen tank on his back.
The scuba divers saw many living things in the ocean. There were corals and seaweed all around. The colourful corals brightened the place. There were starfish, jellyfish, stingrays and octopuses too. They also saw sea urchins, sea horses, swordfish and lobsters.
As the divers swam further, they saw an old ship. They were excited. They knew that treasure could be found in shipwrecks. They swam speedily towards it. Do you think they would find any treasure?
