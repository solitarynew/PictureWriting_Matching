Last week, I watched a circus. It was my first time at a circus and I had a great time.At the entrance, there was a clown handing out balloons to the children. Walking beside him was an Indian juggler.  He was wearing a bright yellow turban. He was juggling five colourful balls.
The circus performers were fantastic. There was a female tightrope walker. She was very good. She balanced on a tight rope and even did hops and skips along the way. There were also acrobats doing handstands and somersaults.  I held my breath as I watched them.
I watched them excitedly. Some adults were snapping photographs.  My grandmother clapped happily when she saw the acrobats. I enjoyed my lollipop while I was watching the show.
