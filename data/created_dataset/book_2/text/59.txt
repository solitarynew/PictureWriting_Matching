During my December school holidays, my parents and I went on a ten-day trip to Australia. At the airport, we checked in our luggage. Then, we took a seven-hour flight to Sydney.
The weather in Sydney was muggy. We checked into a hotel as soon as possible. There were many tourists in the hotel. We walked around the place and took many photographs. We visited the famous opera house and other places of interest.  We also visited beautiful gardens.
At the end of our trip, we had many bags of souvenirs. Mother and I loved shopping the most. Our luggage was filled with so many souvenirs that we almost did not have space to put our own clothes.
