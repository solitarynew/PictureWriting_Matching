I am studying in Tong Tong Primary School. There are about two thousand students and fifty teachers in the school.
My school is located at Houhou Street 10. It is one of the largest schools in the neighbourhood. Its size is impressive. It has three storeys with more than forty classrooms.  My school also has an air-conditioned library, a staff room and a principal's office. There are also study areas that we can go to after school. These places are conducive for studying. There is a big canteen, a bookshop, a basketball court, a playground and a huge field.
I like my school very much. I spend a lot of time studying and playing sports here.
