It was a bright and sunny day. I was taking a stroll in the park when I almost stepped on an oversized egg. I picked it up and took it to my room.
A few days later, cracks started appearing and out came a small lizard-like creature. I fed it. Before long, it grew into a fire-spitting dragon. The dragon and I became good friends. However, when it grew too big for my room, I had to letitgo.
One day, a burglar broke into my house. My dragon came back and chased him away. The news of what my dragon had done spread throughout the town. No one dared to break into my house again.
