Jenny and her cousin, Annie, were at the supermarket. It was a Saturday so the place was very crowded. They had a shopping list because Jenny's mother wanted them to buy some groceries.
At the supermarket, Jenny and Annie walked along the aisles and looked at all the things on the shelves. Jenny looked for the things that her mother needed. She bought eggs, bread, milk and some vegetables. Annie led her to the biscuit shelves. Jenny was pleased to see the biscuits. She liked a packet of assorted biscuits. She decided to buy it. After that, they went to the cashier with their heavy basket.
After paying for their groceries, Jenny and Annie walked home with the heavy bags. Jenny could not wait to go home to try the new biscuits.
