on cnristmas Eve, I went to changi Airport with my father.  We went there to fetch my aunt who was coming from Hong Kong.
The airport was crowded. There were people leaving the country and tourists coming to spend their Christmas in Singapore. They were carrying heavy luggage. We checked the arrival time of my aunt's plane at the arrival board. Finally, we spotted her. She was collecting her luggage. When my aunt walked out, I rushed forward to hug her. My father helped her to put her heavy luggage onto a trolley. Then, we pushed the trolley to the car.
I could not wait to spend time with my aunt. I planned to take her to the Singapore Zoo and the Science Centre. I would also let her try Singapore food.
