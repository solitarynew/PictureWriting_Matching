Mark was home alone one Sunday evening. His parents had to attend a wake. He was sitting comfortably on the sofa reading a book.
Suddenly, the doorbell rang. He peeped through the hole and saw a man dressed in a suit. "Who are you?" Mark asked.
“I am Uncle Peter from Malaysia.  I'm your father's friend," he replied.
“Please wait," Mark answered.
Then, he quietly called his father on his mobile phone. When his father told him that he did not know such a person, Mark was shocked. He hurriedly went back to the door and shouted, "Sorry, you've got the wrong house." Then, he ran to his bedroom and huddled in bed.
