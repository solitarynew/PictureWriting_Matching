When my mum came home from work, she would always have a bag of pastries with her. I was puzzled. I had not seen a pastry shop nearby. I really liked the pastries. I would gobble down at least two and take another two to school the next day.
One day, I took a different route home from school.  I saw a crowded confectionery on the way. It had just opened. People were queuing up to pay for the food. There were many shelves of delicious looking bread and cakes.
The aroma of freshly baked pastries made my stomach growl. Now I knew where my mother bought the pastries. I went home happily. I could not help wondering what type of pastries my mother would bring home next.
