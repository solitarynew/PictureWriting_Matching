Linda and her sister, Laura, always take a walk in the neighbourhood park in the evening. They like the park very much.
There are beautiful plants and big shady trees. They enjoy the greenery at the park very much. There is also a small pond. Sometimes, they sit on a bench by the pond to watch the colourful fish swim in the water. They laugh when they see the fish leaping out of the water.
The girls also like to rent bicycles from the bicycle kiosk. Laura always takes the front seat because Linda does not know how to cycle. They have a great time cycling around the park.
