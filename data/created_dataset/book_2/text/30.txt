I grew up in Ang Mo Kio.  I befriended many people there and I knew the neighbourhood like the back of my hand. However, when I was ten years old, my family and I moved to a new neighbourhood - Seng Kang.
I was shocked and very upset. I had to move to a new school. Most of my classmates already had their own friends. They did not want to be friends with me.I did not like the change of environment. The new place was too quiet. The bustling town in my old neighbourhood was gone.
There were very few residents in Seng Kang and my neighbour's children looked very unfriendly. I could not play with my neighbours like I used to. I wished I could move back to Ang Mo Kio as my life there had been much more fun.
