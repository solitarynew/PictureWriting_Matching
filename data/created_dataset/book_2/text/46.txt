Among all the stories that I have read, I love those stories about horses the most.I think they are the most elegant and disciplined creatures in the world.I have loved stories about horses since I was young.One of my favourite is 'Black Beauty'.
There are many stories about horses.  They usually appear in stories as heroes.  The knight usually rides a horse to a battle and rescues the princess from danger.
The horse has to brave the wind and rain and gallop through rough terrain. A frightened horse has been known to throw its rider off its back. Horses are therefore very important creatures.
