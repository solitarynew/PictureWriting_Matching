Jeffrey could hardly contain his excitement. He was on his way to the computer laboratory with his classmates. It was not the first time he was going there but it was the first time he would be allowed to use the Internet.
Everyone found their seats and settled down quickly. Jeffrey and his classmates were familiar with the computer and knew how to turn it on. Their teacher taught them how to access the Internet. She instructed them to go to a search engine. Then, she taught them how to use keywords to search for information. Jeffrey and his classmates did not need much help from their teacher. They found what they needed easily. Jeffrey was amazed that so many things could be found on the Internet.
Jeffrey was so engrossed in what he was doing that he did not hear the bell ring. He was disappointed when his teacher told them to shut down the computer and return to their classroom. He could not wait for the next computer lesson.
