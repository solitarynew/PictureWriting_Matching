Two astronauts had a space shuttle.  They had travelled to outer space in the space shuttle. There were many colourful buttons on the control panel. The control panel looked complicated. The astronauts pressed the different buttons to take the space shuttle to outer space.
After travelling for a long time, the astronauts reached outer space. When they landed on a planet, they came out of their space shuttle. They wore space suits.
The astronauts saw aliens in outer space. They were not afraid of the aliens because they looked friendly. They bravely went forward to befriend them.
