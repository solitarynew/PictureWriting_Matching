Tom was shocked to see a giant when he entered the house. He was like a midget next to it. He trembled in fright. He was about to run away when he realised that the giant was just a huge balloon.Tom giggled. He hoped that no one had seen how frightened he was.
Tom's friends were dressed in a variety of costumes. Henry was dressed as a King. He wore a golden crown on his head and a long purple robe on his body.  Marie was dressed as a queen. She wore a beautiful gown with sequins. She looked elegant. Jane was a princess and Jack was a prince. Jack asked Jane to dance with him. They whirled around the room as the music played. Everyone laughed and clapped.Steve was a squire. He had a fake beard on his face. Mark was a lion-hearted knight. They looked very different in their costumes. l almost could not recognise them. Brian was dressed as ajester. He had a bright red hat with gold bells on it. Alan was a minstrel. He played beautiful music.
Tom and his friends had a lot of fun at the fancy dress party. They pretended that they were in fairytale land. Everyone had a great time.
