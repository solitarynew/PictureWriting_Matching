My grandfather is seventy years old. He is almost bald and his face is covered with wrinkles but he is still very lively. Every day, he reads the newspapers after breakfast.
In the morning, he goes to his friend's house to chat and play chess with him. At noon, he will buy lunch from the nearby food centre for my brother and me. We have lunch together. We tell our grandfather about our day. Later, he will help us with our homework. No matter how difficult our work is, he always knows the answers.
After dinner, my grandfather always watches television programmes for an hour. He loves to watch comedies. He thinks they are hilarious. I love my grandfather very much. I think he is an interesting and fun person.
