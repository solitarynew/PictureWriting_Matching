I have a pet named Kitty but it is not a cat. It is a dog. I call her Kitty because I love the toy 'Hello Kitty'. My friends laugh when I tell them her name but Kitty does not mind. She always runs to me when I call her name.
Kitty always wags her tail when I come home from school. I spend afternoons training her to obey simple commands.  Every evening, I take her to the neighbourhood park for a walk. Kitty is an obedient dog. She does not run off when she sees other dogs. She will stay by my side. Sometimes, I do not even have to use a leash.
Although I like having Kitty as a pet, it is not easy to look after her. I have to bathe her once a week.I also have to brush her fur every day.However, I have a lot of fun taking care of Kitty.I do not mind the hard work.vi
