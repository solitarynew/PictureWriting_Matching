My sister has been living in San Francisco for many years. She has a wonderful and good-looking husband. They have two daughters and a son.
The son is the youngest in the family. He is quite pampered. My sister and her husband buy him everything he wants.  He has many computer games, toys and books. He often spends many hours at the computer. He will throw a tantrum when he cannot get to play his favourite game.
Their two daughters are twins.  They are often dressed the same way. It is hard to tell them apart.They enjoy reading just like my sister. They spend many hours reading and playing with their dols. I miss my sister and her family. I try to visit them once a year.
