I stay in Serangoon. Nex is a stone's throw from my home. Wheneverl go to Nex, I will go to a bookshop on the fourth floor. There are many books there. like to browse through them.
There are many other shops in the mall too. I can buy my favourite snacks at the supermarket and I can also visit the electronic goods shop. It is a small shop but it is packed with the latest gadgets. I used to enjoy watching movies at the cinema there too.
I like spending time at the mall No matter how weary I am after a day at school, a visit to my favourite shops always perks me up.
