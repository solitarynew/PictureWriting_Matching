I have liked small animals since I was young.  especially love dogs, rabbits and cats.  When I turned five, my parents let me keep these animals as pets.
I have two puppies, three rabbits and a family of cats. At first, I was worried that they would not get along but I was wrong. They are best friends. They often play with one another. They are also good companions when I am bored. My father teaches me how to take good care of them. He shows me how to feed them. He also helps me to clean their homes. He tells me that I have to take good care of my pets even when I am tired or busy. They will be upset if I do not take proper care of them.
I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up. Then, I can help animals that are sick and make them well again.
