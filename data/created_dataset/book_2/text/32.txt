The email replaces the traditional postage system for many people. It has become very popular nowadays.
l use the email quite often. l use it to send letters to my pen pals from all over the world. They can read my messages anytime. I can also read what they write to me immediately after they send it.
The email is like a post-box. I must read my messages and delete those I do not want. Sometimes, when I am busy with my schoolwork, I forget about my messages. When I open my in-box, there are already many messages waiting for me. I enjoy reading messages from my friends but I do not like to receive advertisements.  I will usually delete those straight away.
