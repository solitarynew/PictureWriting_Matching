A turtle looked up into the blue sky. He saw an eagle soar above him. He wanted to fly like the majestic bird.
The foolish turtle climbed to the top of a cliff. When he leapt off the cliff and started flapping his legs, he realised that he could not fly. He began to panic. He was falling very fast. â€˜Help!" he shouted.
It was too late! He was falling faster and faster. He was moving too fast to grab onto anything. He fell onto a boulder with a crash. His shell broke into pieces. That was the end of the foolish turtle.
