â€œDon't worry, Mrs Ling. Take the medicine I've prescribed and you'll get well very soon," Dr Andrews told Mrs Ling. She nodded and smiled at him. Then, she shuffled out of the room.
Mrs Ling waited for a short while.  Then, the nurse called her name and she went to the counter to collect her medicine.  There were several packets of medicine and Mrs Ling was not sure how she had to take them. She asked the nurse repeatedly how to take the medicine. The nurse patiently explained herself again. However, Mrs Ling shook her head and smiled in confusion. By then, another two patients had come out of the consultation room. A man with his arm in a sling tapped his foot impatiently. He was getting annoyed.
By the time Mrs Ling understood the medicine she was supposed to take, there were five people waiting to collect their medicine. The nurse apologised to them. Mrs Ling just smiled and hobbled out of the clinic.
