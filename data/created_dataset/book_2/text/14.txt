Paul has been living alone with his mother since his father died. His mother has to work long hours so Paul has to take care of himself. He is an independent boy.
Every morning, he prepares his own breakfast. When he returns home from school, he buys a packet of chicken rice for lunch. After taking a shower, he sweeps and mops the floor. Then, he folds the clothes and puts them neatly in the closet. When the household chores are done, he does his homework and revises what his teacher has taught him.
In the evening, he walks to the nearby coffee shop to buy his dinner. He eats and watches his favourite television programme at the same time. At about nine o'clock, his mother returns from work. He will tell her what he has done that day. She is glad that she has such a well-behaved son.
