The Ang Mo Kio Community Club organised a fun fair last weekend. It was for charity. I went there with my parents.
There were many stalls on the large field near the club. Throngs of people visited the stalls.I begged my parents to take me to the game stalls. There were so many games to play. I hit cans and threw hoops.At last, I won a prize.It was a huge teddy bear.
My parents also enjoyed themselves. There was a stage performance. The comedian told a lot of jokes and stories. Everyone roared with laughter.
