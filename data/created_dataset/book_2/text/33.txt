Since I was young, I have had the habit of writing a diary. Some people think that this is a waste of time butI think otherwise.
I can easily remember what happened in the past when I read my diary. I can remember happy and sad days and how I have celebrated all my birthdays.
What I write in it depends on howI feel that day. I will write about what happens in a day. If something bad happens, I will be sad or angry. Sometimes, I laugh at myself for some silly acts I havedone.
Ilove my diary. It is like watching my own movie because the past can be replayed when I read them.
