It was a beautiful Sunday morning. The air was clean and a slight breeze was blowing. It was the perfect day for a picnic. My family and I decided to go to the beach. I helped my mother prepare some food for the picnic while my brother helped my father to pack our things.
We arrived at our destination at eleven o'clock. Many people had already spread out their picnic mats but we were able to find a good spot to put our things. There were many people at the beach. Some were having a suntan.  Others were swimming in the sea.A few of them were relaxing on their hammocks.
My brother and I quickly changed into our swimming trunks. We ran towards the sea and jumped into the water. My father joined us shortly. My mother lay out the mat and watched us play. At noon, we had our lunch. My brother and I built sandcastles with our shovels and buckets.At about five in the evening, we began packing. We were very tired but happy. We had an enjoyable time at the beach.
