â€œJanet! Where are you?" Mrs Lim shouted at the top of her voice. A few people turned around to stare at her. Janet was nowhere in sight. Mrs Lim was frantic. She dashed to the information counter.
Mrs Lim told the man behind the counter that her daughter was missing. She was almost in tears. The man told her that he would do his best to find her daughter. Mrs Lim told the man thatJanet was wearing a pink dress. She also told the man that Janet had long hair tied in two ponytails. She told him that Janet had gone missing when they were in the shoe department earlier.
After getting all the information, the man made an announcement that was broadcast throughout the entire shopping center. He told Mrs Lim to wait at the information counter. He was sure that someone would see Janet and take her to the information counter.
