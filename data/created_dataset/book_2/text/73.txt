My feet are very important because they help me to do many things. The most basic thing they can do is walk. Walking is a skill learnt from young and it cannot be done without my feet.
My feet also help me run and do many sports. Many sports require the use of my feet. Sports like cycling and soccer make use of all the different parts of my leg, including my feet. Without my feet, I would have a lot of difficulty doing these.
However, my feet are also prone to injury. Therefore, I must take care of my feet. Shoes and other footwear can protect my feet. I always make sure I wear comfortable shoes whenever Igo out.
