Sam was delighted when he saw the sun shining brightly in the sky.It was a Saturday morning. He could spend the morning at the beach.
The place was already packed with people. Fortunately, Sam managed to find a spot under a shady tree. He spread out his mat and tossed his bag on it.He could not wait to jump into the cool clear water. He was about to put one foot into the water when he heard the rumbling of thunder. Looking up in dismay, Sam saw that dark clouds had gathered above him.
Seconds later, huge droplets of rain beat down on him. Sam gathered his things and dashed towards the nearest shelter. He stood there shivering as the rain fell harder and faster.
The rain did not stop that day.It was less heavy an hour later. Sam hurriedly walked home in the drizzle. He spent the rest of the day reading and playing computer games at home. The weather was so unpredictable!
