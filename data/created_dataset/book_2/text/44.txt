It is a rainy day. The ant family is at home. It is cold and wet outside. They do not want to go out. The ants do not like to get wet.
Mother ant is feeding its baby ant with a milk bottle. The baby loves the drink. Father ant is sitting on a couch. Brother ant is watching a cartoon. Sister ant is holding a basket of apples. It is going to give the fruit to its friend later when the rain stops. Grandma ant is cooking in the kitchen.  A nice aroma fills the house. Grandpa ant is playing chess with uncle ant.
They are a cheery and loving family. They enjoy spending time together at home.
