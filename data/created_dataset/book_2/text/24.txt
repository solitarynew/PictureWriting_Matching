"Are you all right, Mike? You look pale," Mrs Chan asked her son. She placed her hand on his forehead and looked at him worriedly. Mike sniffed and looked at his mother with teary eyes. He was feeling miserable.
Mrs Chan wanted to take Mike to the doctor but he refused to go. He hated taking medicine and he was afraid of injections. Since Mrs Chan could not persuade him to visit the doctor, she decided to make Mike a cup of hot tea. Mike brightened up. He liked the tea that his mother made because it was sweet.
Mike took a few sips of the tea. He felt much better after that. His mother told him to take a nap after finishing the tea. Mike hoped that he would get better after he took a nap. Then, he would not have to visit the doctor.
