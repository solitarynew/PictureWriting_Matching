Ryan and Ricky were playing football in a small field below their flat. They were having a great time. Suddenly, Ryan gave the ball such a hard kick that it flew over Ricky's head and out of the field. The ball flew high in the air towards a block of flats. It hit the windowpane of a second storey unit with a crash!
The owner of the house was Mrs Lee. She dashed to the window when she heard the noise. She shouted, "Who broke my window?" The boys were silent. They did not know what to say. They broke out in sweat and trembled with fear.
Ryan finally replied in a quivering voice, "I did. I am very sorry."
Being a good friend, Ricky also said, "We will be responsible for our careless act."
