My mother is Mrs Tan Siew Leng. She is thirty-two years old. She has a fair complexion. She has huge round eyes that light up whenever she is happy.
My mother is a gentle and soft-spoken person. She never raises her voice at me. She is also a competent homemaker. She makes sure that the house is spick and span. She dusts the house every day and cooks delicious meals. She is a great cook.
My father and I look forward to eating her home-cooked food every day. My father says that her food is even better than those served at expensive restaurants.
