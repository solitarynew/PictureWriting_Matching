Lena had just come back from the zoo with her classmates. She had heard so many different animal sound there that she could not wait to tell her mother about them.
Lena told her mother about the lions and tigers. “They roar," she said excitedly. She also told her mother that elephants trumpet. Then, she told her mother about the pigs that she saw. They were dirty and smell and they grunted. Lena also saw a rooster. Although it was not dawn, she heard the rooster crow.
Lena's mother was pleased that she knew so much about the sounds that animals made. She asked Lena if she knew the sound that dogs made. Lena smiled and said confidently that they bark. She also told her mother that donkeys bray.
Just then, they heard a squeak. “Run!" Lena yelled. She was terrified. “"There is a mouse in the house!"
