I am born in the year of the dragon but I am not a dragon. I just love to eat the dragon fruit. I drool whenever I think of the dragon fruit.
The dragon fruit has an odd shape and it looks strange.  However, the dragon fruit is very juicy and tasty. It is not too sweet, sour or bitter. It is also not very expensive.  The dragon fruit has white flesh and tiny edible black seeds.
In the past, I loved durians and mangoes.  Now, the dragon fruit has become my favourite fruit. I eat it every day. My parents buy it for me every day. They say that it contains a lot of vitamins.
