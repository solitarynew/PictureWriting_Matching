A long time ago, people lived in caves. They were known as cave dwellers. There were rocks and boulders everywhere.
The people lived among many big animals. One of them was the mammoth. It had a hairy body and a long curved tusk. It was much larger than the people. There were also saber-toothed tigers. These tigers had sharp fangs.
The animals were fierce and dangerous.  The people had to learn to protect themselves so that they would not be eaten up. They kept a look out for these animals at all times. They also made weapons to fight against these animals.
