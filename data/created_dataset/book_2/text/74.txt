My hands are used for many different purposes. Hands are of different sizes and they are probably the most important part of our body.
I use my hands to write, hold things and also to play my favourite sport - basketball. l also enjoy playing computer games. I use my hands to press and move the controls. Without my hands, I would be unable to write or do my schoolwork. Eating would also be a problem without my hands.
These are just a few things that can be done with my hands. Sometimes, I wish I am able to do all these things at the same time. If only I have multiple pairs of hands!
