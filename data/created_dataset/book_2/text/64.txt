When I am sick, my mother will take me downstairs to visit our family doctor.I have been going to his clinic since I was a baby and the doctor knows me very well.
The glass doors at the clinic are frosted. I cannot see what is inside the clinic when I am standing outside. I will feel a rush of cool air whenever l open the doors.I always wear a sweater when I go to the doctor.
I like this doctor because he is affable. He always gives me a sweet every time I visit. He makes every visit a pleasant experience. After examining me, he will write his diagnosis on a card. He also writes down the medicine he is going to give me. However, his handwriting is so messy that I cannot read what he has written. Only the nurse can read what he is writing.
I do not mind visiting my family doctor. I always feel much better after a visit to his clinic.
