Chicken rice is one of the most popular dishes in Singapore.  It can be found in food centres and posh restaurants everywhere. Chicken rice has become so popular that even a movie was made about it many years ago.
I love chicken rice because of the fragrant rice and the oily chicken skin. Many people say that it is unhealthy to eat too much chicken rice. However, I cannot resist the aroma coming from a chicken rice stall whenever I walk pass.
Chicken rice is part of the Singapore culture and I am sure it is something that will never die out. Therefore, I am certain my favourite food will still be around in the years to come.
