Adrian and his family went to the zoo one Sunday. They took a train to Sembawang MRT station and took a bus from there to the zoo. When they arrived at the zoo, they bought their entrance tickets and went inside. Adrian was bursting with excitement. He had not been to the zoo for a long time. He could not wait to see all the animals.
First, they visited the tigers and lions. Their cubs looked cute but Adrian was afraid of them. He did not dare to go too near the lair. Next, they saw giraffes. One of the giraffes was eating the leaves from a tree. The giraffe was so tall and it had such a long neck. Adrian wondered what it would be like to be so tall Then, they saw many playful monkeys swinging from tree to tree. Adrian was amazed that the monkeys could swing so fast without falling down.
Finally, they had their lunch at the food centre. At about two in the afternoon, they left the zoo and went home. Adrian was exhausted but he had a fruitful day. He was able to see many animals and learn about them.
