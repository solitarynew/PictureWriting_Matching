I used to like dogs. I would pet strangers' dogs whenever I saw them. I was not even afraid when the dogs growled at me. However, I have been fearful of dogs ever since a dog bit me last year.
I was at my friend's house when her dog pounced on me. It bit my leg and blood oozed from the wound. I had to go to the hospital. There was a bandage on my wound for a week.
After that incident, I have always tried to avoid dogs. I am not just afraid of big dogs. Even puppies scare me. I hope one day I can overcome my fear of dogs.vi
