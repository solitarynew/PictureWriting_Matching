Dear Kimmy,
Meet me outside the library at 2 o'clock. This is how you should go from your house. First, walk along Macy Road. Then turn right at Cain Road. Walk along this street for about ten minutes. After that, turn left at Union Street. Finally, go along Union Streetill you see the library.
From, Kammy
