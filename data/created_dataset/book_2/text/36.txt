My best friend, Marie, celebrated her birthday last Friday. She had a party at her terrace house in Serangoon.  When I reached her place, I wished her 'Happy Birthday'. She asked jokingly, “Do you have a present for me?"I grinned and handed her a present. She smiled widely and thanked me.
When all the quests had arrived, the party began. First, Marie played the piano. Next, she sang a popular song. After that, we had a delicious buffet dinner. I ate a plate of fried noodles. Then, I had two fried chicken wings, some sushi and fruits.
At about 9 pm, we sang the birthday song to Marie. She had a huge tiramisu birthday cake. After eating the cake, Marie unwrapped all her presents. Marie shrieked with delight when she saw the presentI had given her. It was a set of figurines from her favourite fairytale - Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Before I went home, I told Marie, “Thank you. I enjoyed myself very much." Marie beamed and thanked me for coming.
