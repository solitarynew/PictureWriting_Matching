It was after the examinations and I was playing with my ball at home. I kicked the ball and it rolled to a corner of the house near the curtains. I was about to pick it up when I noticed a shadow.
I stared at the shadow. Fear crept through me. My imagination ran wild. I thought it looked like a python. I was too frightened to go near the shadow.As I was home alone, I called my neighbour for help.
My neighbour, Mr Lee, was shocked to hear that a snake was in my house.  He came over immediately. He bravely pulled the curtains aside. To our relief, it was just a saw.  My father must have left it there after he worked in the garden.
I felt foolish but Mr Lee praised me. He said that if a snake had been behind the curtains, it was right to call for an adult.
