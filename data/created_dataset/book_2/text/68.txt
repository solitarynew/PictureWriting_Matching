There was a row of interesting stalls along the road. â€œ"Father! What is that?" I asked excitedly. My father said that it was a night market. My brother and I begged him to take us there.
My father parked his car and we headed towards the night market. From a distance, we could hear loud music. It was coming from the stall that sold CDs and VCDs.  There were also many stalls selling food and drinks.
Some stalls had clothes, shoes and belts.  They were very cheap. There were a few stalls that displayed children's games, stationery and stickers.  We had a good time browsing at the stalls. The items were cheap. I wondered if they were durable. My father also had an enjoyable time. He told us that he used to go to night markets when he was a child too. Back then, they did not have so many different stalls.
I wanted an electronic game but my father did not buy it for me. Still, I had a greattime.
