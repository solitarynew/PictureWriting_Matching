Mr Sim is our school gardener. He is an elderly man. He has a head of white hair and many wrinkles on his face.  He is a hardworking man. He goes to work early in the morning and only leaves in the evening.
Every day, he wears a grey T-shirt and a pair of navy blue pants. He does his work very well. He rakes the leaves in the garden once a day. He also trims the bushes and waters the plants. He is very serious when he is doing his work. He does not talk or joke with anyone. He gets annoyed when we try to talk to him while he is doing his work.
However, when he has completed his work, he is a different person. He will talk to us and tell us jokes. He always puts a smile on our faces.  We like Mr Sim very much. We are glad to have him as our school gardener.
