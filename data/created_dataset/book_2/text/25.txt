Dear diary,
The sky was overcast with dark clouds this morning. As usual, I walked to school with my heavy haversack. Soon,it was raining cats and dogs.
I quickly took out my umbrella.I was glad that I had brought my umbrella. However, as I was opening it, a passing truck splashed muddy waterall over me.I was covered from head to toe in dirty muddy water.
I was drenched and very dirty by the time I reached school. I was also late for school. What an unlucky morning!
