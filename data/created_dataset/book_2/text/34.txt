I used to believe there were fairies and I often dreamed about them.  As I grew older, I stopped believing in them, I thought that they were not real.
All this changed one night.I saw a bevy of ladies, about the size of dolls, land on my window sil. They flew around my room. Their wings glowed brightly. I said 'hello' to them. To my surprise, they said 'hello' to me too.
They told me that they were fairies from a faraway land. They told me all about their magical world. After a while, they said goodbye and flew away. They promised to visit me again. I rubbed my eyes.I wondered if I had been dreaming.
