At night when everyone is asleep, my toys wake up and have parties of their own.  They talk to one another and make alot of noise.
Sometimes when I cannot sleep, I get out of bed and join them. I share my sadness and joy with them. They usually listen attentively. Sometimes, I join in their games. It is exciting and fun to play with my toys.At first, I was a little scared, but nowlalways have a great time.
Once, my mother suddenly walked into my room. She asked me whom I was talking to.I pretended thatI was dreaming and went back to my bed immediately. My toys also stopped what they were doing right away. They just stayed very still. My mother did not suspect a thing.
These toys are very special and I will keep them for life. Last year, my mother wanted me to give some of my toys away but I refused. I will never part with the toys.
