Kenny Low is a postman. His job is to deliver letters. Rain or shine, he rides his scooter to deliver letters.
He goes from block to block in the housing estates. He sorts the letters in an orderly way. He makes sure they are slotted into the correct mailbox. Sometimes, he delivers registered mail to people's doorstep.
Kenny is as busy as a bee. Yet, he is always a jovial and caring man.
