Last year, I topped the class in the examinations. My parents were very happy and booked a chalet for me. They also let me invite my friends.  I had an enjoyable time there. There were many things to do.
My friends and I went cycling along the beach nearby.  We also played many games there.  In the evening, we had a barbecue. My relatives were invited. My father grilled the food for us. We even ate durian cake.
After dinner, my parents told my relatives that the chalet was my reward for doing well in the examinations.  I beamed with pride when everyone praised me.
