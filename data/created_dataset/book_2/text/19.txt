Ben and Jenny are both doctors.  They own a clinic in Bishan. The couple work from 9am to 9pm every day. Sometimes, they open earlier or stay later if there are many patients.
They are very kind and caring doctors. Their consultation fee is reasonable, so their clinic is often as packed as sardines. Their patients come from all walks of life. They like the kind and caring service offered by Ben and Jenny.
Ben and Jenny are well-known in the neighbourhood.  Everyone is glad that they have such caring doctors in the neighbourhood.
