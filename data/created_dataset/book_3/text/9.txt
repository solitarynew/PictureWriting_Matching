My father turned down a street, drove for a
while and made a left turn into another street. After
making another right turn, he drove up a multi-storey
car park. We were on our way to Little India. My
father's Caucasian friend, Jeff, was Visiting from
America and we wanted to show him some of the
interesting sights in Singapore.
Once we stepped out of the car park and onto
the street, we smelt a mixture of Indian spices. Some of
them were pungent, but some were aromatic. We
started the tour at Serangoon Road and walked dawn
Hastings Road before we turned into Little India Arcade.
There were many attractive things for sale. As we
continued to walk to Campbell Lane, we saw a shop
packed with jewellery, peacock feathers, Punjabi suits
and joss sticks. Jeff spent a long time in the shop,
looking for souvenirs for his family. My father managed
to bargain for a lower price for the items.
Jeff was thrilled to see the wide variety of things
and the large number of people in traditional Indian
attire. We took some photos for him at the Sri
Veeramakaliamman Temple. The tour concluded with
some tasty dosai and a glass of lassi. Everyone had a
great time.
Despite almost the whole day there, we
were unable to visit all the places. Jeff had to leave for
the airport that night. He promised to visit us again
soon and we agreed to take him to other places of
interest. I could not wait to visit those places too.
