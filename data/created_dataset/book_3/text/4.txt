"Get dressed, Maria," my mother told me. I
hurriedly shut down the computer. Mv parents were
going to Chinatown and I was going with them. We go
- there once a fortnight but I am not tired Of going there.
I always find it interesting.
My family and I like the place because it is always
bustling with activity. Both old and new shops can be
found there. Some of the shops have been there for
decades and some shops have just sprung up recently.
Some of the older shops sell toys that my parents had
played With when they were children. I like the toys.
They are simple and cheap, vet fun to play with. My
favourite are the coloured paper balls and small animal-
shaped plastic toys.
Besides shopping, my parents and I also go to the
temple to pray. The temple is always very crowded.
People come from all over Singapore to pray there. My
parents and I hold joss sticks and kneel in front of the
altar as we pray. Just before we leave the temple, my
parents will visit a fortune teller. He is very popular
because his predictions are accurate. My parents tell
me that he also writes good luck messages for people.
My mother always visits the fortune teller to ask him if
our family will enjoy good health.
I enjoy going to Chinatown. There is a mix Of
both the old and the new. I prefer going there to the
modern shopping malls in my neighbourhood.
