With everything that happens zround me.
morning at about G I hear
first MRT train Whiz past and see a group Of factory
workers in their pale blue uriforms rush Off to woâ€¢k_
The flow Of traffic along the 'Oad StartS with a trickle
and scon grows into a steady stream during the
morning peak hours. Students who lug heavy bags soon
begin to appear at the bus-stop, followed by Office
sardines. In no time, homemakers with heaw baskets
shuffle past me as they make their way home from the
market_
As the day ends, the whole area is scon
blanketed in darkness. Only the lights from the street
lamps guide people and cars on their journey. The
traffic dows down with only a few taxis and some night
shift W)rkers going to work. I will hear crickets around
me anc sometimes the bark of lone dogs.

like to have a friend.
