playing squash
On Sundays, accompany my parents to the
Sports Club where they play squash, I am too yourg to
play as do not have the strength to hold the racquet.
Howezer, I enjoy watching them. Sometimes, I get so
carried away will and cheer for elthe- my
motler or father. In the game, my father WIII hit the ball
agairst the wall. After it bounces, my mother Will hit the
ball. Sometimes. when it is mv father's turn, he Will miss
the tnll and my mother will hit it again. They run about
from left to right in the court, hitting the ball as ha-d as
they can. By the time their game is over, they are
sweating profusely and paning continuouslv.
My mother is a better squash player than my
fath&. She runs faster and she sometimes leaps into
the to hit the ball. My father is not as alert and he
usually misses the ball. There were a few times when he
ran right into mv mother. However. nothin2 serious
and thev always End up laughing about i'.
I hope I can play squash like my mother when I
am clder. Fc:r now, Will irritate her moves when I am
watching her Outside the court.
