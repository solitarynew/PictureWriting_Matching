If I were a bird, I would like to stay in Jurong Bird
park and be part of this paradise. Although it is a tourist
attraction with many manmade facilities, the place has
been made to closely resemble my habitat in the wild.
At the park, I would not have to worry about
predators. Here, I would be well taken care of by a
group of dedicated keepers. I would live with those
from my own in specially designed aviaries. I
would also be given food at regular times by the
keepers. What do not like are the people who
sometimes like to gawk at me. Once, a naughty boy
threw his toy at me. I was almost injured.
When I fly about in the sky, I would have a
panoramic view of the park. It would as interesting
as staying in the wild. Sometimes, I would perform in
exciting bird shows. Everyone would be astounded by
my tricks. If I am able to, I might even fly to the
magnificent manmade waterfall for a drink.
The Jurong Bird Park would be a haven for me.
How nice it would be to be a bird!
