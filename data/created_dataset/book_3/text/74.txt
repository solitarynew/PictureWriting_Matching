A few weeks ago, I hzd a slight toothache
chose to ignore it, However, the pain Soon
unbe*able and my mother decided to take me to a
dental clinic.
With sweaty palms, I walked hesitantly into the
clinic. The friendly dentist beamed at me and invited me
to sit on a chair. The chair reclined and I gripped the
armrests in fear, The dentist boked into my mouth with
a miror and gave mean injection to numb the nerves in
my mouth. Then, he cleaned my teeth and put in the
filling. I shut my eyes as I did not want to watch him put
the different instruments into my mouth,
Finally, he was done. tt was an agonising twenty
minut2s. Although did not feel any pain, my legs were
still shaking when got off the chair. The dentist gave
me advice on how to take care of my teeth. I nodded
and hurried out of the clinic.
I vowed to take care of my teeth from now
On. did not want to have my teeth filled again.
