Besides participating in many outdoor activities, I
love tc play indtnr games as well. When was younger,
my uncle taught me how to gay chess. Chess is a
that n2eds skill and strategy, and one needs to plan

Many of my classmetes like to build mcdel
aeroplanes. On weekends, I would go to my friend's
house to build rnodel fighter jets. We wculd
painstakingly paint the tin.' pieces and glue them
together to build our fighter jets. We proudly display
our model fighter jets after completing them.
Sometimes When it rains, I cannot go to my
friends house. I would play five stones with mv si<er.
When we get bored With pl"ing five stones, we would
dance. We remember the dence steps we learnt when
we were in kindergarten. Although it is not as fun as
building model fighter jets, I enjoy seeing my cute Ittle
sister giggle.
Although I prefer to play outdoors, I do not mind
playire indoors as well. There are many activities to do
indoors. I will never be bored indoors.
