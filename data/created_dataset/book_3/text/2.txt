Changi Village is located in the Eastern part Of
Singapore. There are old flats, small shops, a variety of
food outk+; and a beach there. Fishermen and cyclists
like tovisit the place. On weekends, the food outlets are
also packed with people who want to take a break trom
their hectic lifestyle.
The beach at Changi Village is very popular
among locals and tourists. Some go to the beach for a
swim in the cool waters, some enjoy setting up tents
and camping there for a night. Others just want to enjoy
the breeze. Cycling is also a popular sport. There are
many bicycle rental shops there. Both the young and
old can be seen cycling along the path between the
beach and the road.
In the evening, visitors often have their dinner at
the eating outlets. In the past, there were only
coffeeshops. Today, there are restaurants. The seafood
restaurants are especially popular. Sitting outdoors, just
a short distance from the sea, makes many visitors feel
as though they are at a resort.
Many visitors are also attracted to the shops at
Changi Village. There are clothing shops, shops Lhat sell
table linen and even electronic goods. Some of the
shops even sell unique trinkets. Although the shops
look run down, they do sell many interesting items.
Changi Village is certainly an interesting place to
visit. My parents and I go there occasionally. I wish I can
go there more often.
