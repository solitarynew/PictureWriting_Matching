On a balmy Saturday afternoon, my aunt took
my cousins and me to pasir Ris Park at Elias Road. I was
thrilled. I loved to spend time with my cousins and it
was my first time at the park. I had heard many
interesting things about the park and I could not wait to
spend the afterncrÂ»n there.
It was rather crowded when we arrived. There
were beautiful palm trees and shady coconut trees.
There were people swimming in the sea, children
running along the sand and families having picnics.
Some parents also took their children to the Adventure
playground. Other than the typical seesaw, swings,
slides and roundabout, there was also a mini labyrinth.
There were squeals of delight in the air as the children
ran around in the maze trying to find their way out.
My cousins, my aunt and I walked along the
beach, enjoying the cool breeze and listening to the
occasional big waves roar. Then, we had an early dinner
at a food outlet nearby. We had barbecued fish and
tasty sticks of satay dipped in spicy peanut sauce. My
cousins and I could not Stop eating. We ate stick after
stick of satay. It was the most delicious meal we had
eaten for a long time,
It was dark by the time we finished dinner. My
cousins and were exhausted. We dozed off in the car
as my aunt drove as home.
