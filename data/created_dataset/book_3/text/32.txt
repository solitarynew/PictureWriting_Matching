There are many different types of neighbours. If
we are lucky, we might get trose who are friendly and
considerate. However, there are also neighbours Who
are aloof and do not like to talk to others. However, the
worst type of neighbours are whose who are simply
unpleasant to live next to.
nekt docr ne$bours are the most
inconsiderate people I know. There are three in
the family. The mother wakes up at five every morning,
and starts cooking. Waking up to the aroma of cooked
>hould acrually De pleasant. NOWever, It IS the
clanging of her pots and pan; that annoys me. I have
been rudely awakened by her many times. Even
she does not disrupt my sleep. I would be woken up
again awhile later. Then, the father Will holler at his son
to wake him up. His son obvi0Jslv does not budge from
bed as the yelling goes on for rr,ore than fifteen
minutes.
-he family also has a dog that barks loudly
throughout the day. S•metimes, in the afternoon, my
neighbour lets it out Of the house. It wanders about the
neighbourhood and it likes to creep up behind an
unsusæctine nasser-hv and thpn hark Nr, in
my neighbourhood likes the cog. Younger children are
terrified of it.
I hope my neighbours will move out soon. I
dislike Eving next to such unpleasant people.
