Darren was bursting with excitement. He was on
his way to the treetop walk in MacRitchie with his
parents. The treetop walk isa walk along a bridge that
connects the two highest points in MacRitchieâ€”Bukit
Pierce and Bukit Kalang.
When they reached MacRitchie, Darren and his
parents had to walk a long way before they reached the
bridge. Along the way, Darren stopped to observe and
take photographs of many birds, insects and plants.
There were birds with bright red feathers and birds with
dull brown feathers. There were insects that were so
small, Darren almost missed them. Then, there were
large ones that were crawling on the branches of the
trees. Darren spotted these insects immediately.
When thev reached the bridge, Darren stepped
cautiously onto it. He thought it looked unstable as it
was very high up. Darren gripped the sides very tightly
as he was afraid Of falling down. At first, he felt giddy
being so high up. He did not dare to look down. To calm
him down, his father held his hand. After a while,
Darren realised that the bridge was not as dangerous as
he had thought. He let go Of his father's hand and
peered down at the foliage beneath. He gazed at the
canopy Of trees around him in delight. Darren was so
high up that he could even see a nest hidden among the
leaves of a tree. Darren's parents took photographs of
everything that he pointed out as he wanted to make a
scrapbook of his outing.
By the time Darren reached the other end of the
bridge, he was exhausted. However, as he walked back
to the car, he asked his equally tired parents if they
could take him there again the next day.
