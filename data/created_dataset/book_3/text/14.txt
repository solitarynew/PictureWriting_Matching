"Hurray! We're going to Sentosa again!" I yelled
when my mother told me the good news. My family and
I love to visit Sentosa. Although we can drive into the
island, we usually take a cable car there. From the cable
car, we get a bird's eye view of Singapore. After the
short ride, we will arrive at Sentosa.
One of the places we visit first is the Merlion. The
Merlion on is a replica of Singapore's well-
known symbol. It is thirty-seven metres high and is half
lion, half fish. My family and I go to the top of the
Merlion. Everything looks like ants from where we are
standing. Next, we will visit underwater World. This
place is home to more than two thousand fish. We get
to touch the starfish and stingray. We also get on a
travellator that takes us through a tunnel where we will
be surrounded by marine creatures. I like to run my
hands over the glass panel and watch the fish follow
them. Our last stop is usually the beach where my
parents and I will play a game Df volleyball together.
Although there are many other attractions in
Sentosa, my family and I usually go to the same
attractions. By then, we will not have the time to visit
the Other attractions. However, the next time we visit
Sentosa, we are going to watch a musical extravaganza
It is a performance with beautiful music, dance and
colour by the sea.
As continues to develop, I know that
there will always be something interesting to see there.
I cannot wait for my next trip.
