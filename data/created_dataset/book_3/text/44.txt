love participating in â€¢jutdoor activities. Since I
was a pung boy, my parents have Often taken me to
the beach on weekends to swim and fly kites. It is fun
playing with my father and brother. They have taught
me many tnings especially hmv 10 fly kltes. With
help, Know how to tug at the kite string occasionally to
keep the kite in the air.
When I started going to school, our P.E. teacher
taught us many sports. We learnt how to play
basket.all and badminton. We also learnt how to do
the long jump and leap over hurdles to represent our
class during the annual sports meet. It is fun learning to
play sc many new sports.
During recess, my friends and would gather
round the sandpit to play marbles. Sometimes, we
wouldolav hide-and-seek. MV marbles alwavs rolled too
far away or bounced out Of the sandpit. I seldom won
but I enjoyed myself tremerbusly.
Participating in these outdoor activities is not
only fun, it also helps to keep me fit and healthy. I am
looking forward to taking part in other activities that I
have never tried before.
