My siblings and I love tc jog. We are so
passionate about it that we jog almost day.
Sometimes, we jog at the park near our hcuse.
Sometimes, we go to the stadium to jog on the track.
We prefer the park because there is a playground there
and we can go there after our jog. We tried runnire on
the treadmill but it is different from jo√¶ing outdoors. I
the fresh air outdoors and the beautiful scenery
at the park.
Joggirg is one of the simplest exercises NO
equipment ig All
comfortable clothing and a pair of running shoes. When
I was six years Old, my father, Who is a physical
education teacher, extolled the importance Of jozing_
He told me that it would help me to stay healthy. It
would also help me to Stay trim and not puton weight.
At first, I did nor trlieve mm. I thought that
jogging would make me sweaty and tired, but I was
wrorg. After my first Jog, I felt refreshed and energetic,
I could not wait to go for my next jog after that. I
persuaded my siblings to jon me.
I am glad that I have taken up jogging. Althcugh
have started playing other sports like tennis and
badminton, still like jogging best. I have started jcgging
longzr distances. I do not think there will be another
sport that will be better than jogging.
