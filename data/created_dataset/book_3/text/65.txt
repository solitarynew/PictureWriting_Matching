Reading a map is tedious. Drawing one tikes
even more effort as much planning is needed to ensure
accurzcy. My sister and I learnt how to draw one atthe
Singapore Science Centre.
Before we began, we learnt how to read the map
Of Singapore 50 that we would understand the symbols
and signs used in a map. After that, we were led to an
area cutside the building. We were told to draw a map
of tha: area. We took note Of all the landmarks andthe
distan:e we walked from Ole landmark to the next.
Even the different kinds of trees
and ponds
there had to be noted.
After our walk, we returned indoors where we
were given a blank piece Of FEper to draw our map. We
had to go outdoors a few times to check that we had
drawn our map correctly. Finally, we managed to d-aw
a simple map Of the area. It -:ook us the Whole day iust
to draw a simple one. We were ver/ pleased With the
maps we had drawn.
My sister and I thought of the different types of
maps used far navigation b'/ pilots and sailors. These
had tc be in greater detail than the ones we had drawn.
They also covered a wider area. We were amazed at
how these maps were draw.. asked my sister if she
wanted to draw a map Of our neighbourhood next. She
readily agreed.
