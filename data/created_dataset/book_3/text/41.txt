"I think I'll wear the yellow scarf today," my
mothe said uncertainly, She •ad a frown on her face as
she ran her hands through the row Of colourful scarves
in her wardrobe. I shook m/ head and smiled at my
mnthgr_ She had lots Df accessories and she was always
undecided about which ones to wear whenever she
went out. My mother tried on a yellow scarf, but she
said that it dd not match her outfit. She tried a
green scarf next and was pleased with what she saw.
After selecting a scarf. I watched as my mother
a drawer filled With watches. Ghe reached for
hexagon-shavEd watch with a black and silver strap.
Then, she sat down at her dressing table and put on her
make-up. When she was dore, she put a green beaded
necklace around her neck. She also put on a matching
bracelet. Then, my mother at her reflection in
the nirror_ She smiled. She was pleased. I smiled •.00.
My mother had certainly transformed her plain looking
T-shirt and jeans into a beautiful outfit.
My mother loved wezring accessories. She cnce
told me that her outfit would not be complete urless
she wore accessories with it. When my mo:her
traveled, she carried most cf her accessories with her.
She wanted to make sure that she always had
something to match her outfts.
I found it amusing see my mother dolling
herself up whenever she vent out. I wondered if I
would be like her too when I grew up.
