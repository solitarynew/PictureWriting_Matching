I watched an interesting show last week. A young
girl was granted three wishes by a tairy. It I were given
three Wishes, I would wish for things that Will be
beneficial to society. It Will be selfish and self-centred
Of if I wish for things that only
First, I will wish for peace in the world. Today,
there is unrest in many ccuntries and many innocent
people are suffenng. I wish that the leaders would
their countries fairlv and justly for the gojd Of
society. Many leaders do r√út treat the people in their
courtry well ana there are often violent fights. Many
people will lose their lives ir this way.
Next, I will wish for peace in the family. Manv
children grow up today in single-parent families. I would
WISh for parents to get along with each Other sc that
children can grow UP in a complete family. I wish that
family members would love and one another
and live in peace. Third, I WSh that everyone would play
a roe in caring for the environment. If we contirue to
waste our precious resources and not take care of the
environment, it will be an uphill task trying to reverse
Wha could be an disaster.
If only I could meet a fairy. would ask for these
thre wishes. With these three wishes, I am sure the
word will be a better placeto live in.
