Located at the end of a long quiet road is the
Singapore Zoological Gardens. It is a popular tourist
attraction in Singapore. Although it is far from
residential areas, it is easily accessible by car, bus and
taxi. Being a favourite among the locals, it is Often very
crowded on weekends and on school holidays.
The zoo is hailed as one of the best in the world.
There are many different animals placed in enclosures
that resemble their natural habitat. Visitors have a
chance to get up close to the animals and observe their
behaviour. They can watch the elephants take a bath or
roll about On the sand. They can also watch the giraffes
reach for the leaves on the tall trees. What most visitors
like to watch are the chimpanzees, gibbons and orang
utans. These animals swing with great agility from tree
to tree. They look like gentle Creatures but are actually
very strong. If visitors go at the right times, they will
also be able to watch the feeding times.
The more vicious animals such as the cheetah
and lions have different enclosures. The cheetahs live in
a cage, There is a huge moat in front of the lions'
enclosure so that visitors will not get too close to the
lions. Although these animals look sluggish, they are
actually ferocious. Visitors should not go too near or
poke items through the bars of the cage.
A visit to the zoo can take an entire day. Visitors
are not only able to look at the different animals in their
enclosures, they can also watch animal shows. For the
children, there are play areas for them. The zoo
certainly caters to many different groups Of people.
