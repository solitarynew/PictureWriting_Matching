When my aunt got married last month, she and
her husband took many photographs after the
ceremony. My brothers and l, together with our
relatives, went to Fort Canning park. I had never been
therebefore. I was surprised to find out how big it was.
At the entrance, my aunt and her husband took a
photograph. At first, I thought that the park was dull
with nothing but overgrown grass and would not be a
good place to take photographs. I was wrong. There
was a huge green field with a long wall on either side.
On closer look, I realised that the walls were actually
tombstones. While my aunt and uncle were taking
photographs, I walked ahead and explored an area that
was supposed to be a royal tomb, Some people believe
that an old ruler of Singapore was buried there.
Before we left Fort Canning Park, my aunt and
her husband tCH)k a photograph in the middle of the
field. There was a huge building behind them. It
stretched almost the length of the field. It was dull grey.
My aunt told me that the building was a former
barracks for British soldiers.
I had an interesting time at Fort Canning park.
My aunt told me that she would take me there again for
a picnic. I have been reading up on the place. I cannot
wait to go there again.
