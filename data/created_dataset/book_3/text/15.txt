"I'll take you to an interesting place today," my
grandfather said with a twinkle in his eye. I could not
wait. My grandfather is an adventurous man who often
visits new places. I was surprised when he told me to
wear the outfit that I usually wore to the park. Curious, I
asked him where we were going but he refused to tell
me. He said that it would be a surprise.
It was a short bus ride to the place. When we
reached our destination, I found myself standing at the
entrance to a huge park, "This is the Singapore Botanic
Gardens," my grandfather said as he spread his arms
out beside him. There was excitement in his voice.
Holding my hand, he led me through a garden
filled with plants of all shapes and sizes. There were
plants with huge leaves and plants with leaflets. Some
were bushes that grew along the sides. Others were
huge trees and some were vines that grew alone the
trunks of the taller trees. My grandfather also told me
the names of the different plants and showed me the
different parts Of the plants. There were colourful
butterflies flitting among the flowers. I ran about trying
to catch them while my grandfather rested on a bench.
My grandfather also showed me the orchid plants. I was
surprised to see so many different orchids in such a
wide variety of colours. I especially liked one of the
species. It was deep purple in the centre with pure
white petals.
That night, I had a dream of myself living in a
garden that was filled with laughing flowers and talking
trees. I wished the trees and plants I had seen at the
Botanic Gardens would come alive.
