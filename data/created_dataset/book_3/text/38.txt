My brother, Dave, is a talented musician. He can
play tyree musical instruments very well. He has been
learnirz to play them since he was five years old. His
favourte is the piano. I love listening to him play. He
will play the piano every day end whe
at home. He always obliges When my parents ask him to
play far their guests. He keeps them spellbound With
his mandious tunes.
Dave is not just good at playing the piano. He is
also an outstanding drummer. He picked this up only a
year but now he is playing so well that he is gaing
to tale part in a competition soon. My parents think
that tie drums are too noisy but I like the thumping
beat Of the drums. will Sit Dave's bed and listen to
him Olay almost every afternoon. The sounc is
deafening but I enjoy it. Dave is so engrossed in his
music that he can SDend entire afternoons playing He
does not even realise that the afternoon has passed and
it is dhner time.
Dave also plays the guitar. He became interested
in it after watching a well-known guitarist perform. He
began taking lessons a few months ago. Already, he is
Ais teacher Often praises
him.
Dave's dream is to form his own band. Whenever
he watches a band on he will tell us that he
wants to play in such a band. He likes playing and h? is
happywhenever others enjoy his music.
