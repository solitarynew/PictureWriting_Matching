stories and Science fiction. Enid Blyton is my favourite
writer. In fact, I have a whole bookshelf at home Vith
only E-ud Blyton's
I started to read the books When I was aboutfive
years old. The simple Noddy jooks, which read at first,
had many colourful pictures that accompanied the
stories. Later, went on to read the series 'Bedtime
Tales'. Enid Blyton has created a wonderful make-
believe world in Which all my dreams can come rue.
There is no violence in her tales and good always
triumohs over evil.
Last week, during Show and Tell, I brought my
favowite book to school. ht was dog-eared and the
pages were slightly yellow as I have had it for many
years. I told my classmates about the Story and why I
found the book so entertaning. Some of them even
askec to borrow my book after that. However, I auld
not to part With my favourite storybook.
I do not know When I will outgrow her but
will ba Whøn I
have children next time, I will introduce them to Enid
Blytm's books as well.
