few years ago, my father was diagnosed wth
cancer. My mother decided tc take on the job Ot beng
the breadwinner Of the family While my father stap2d
home. ro pass his time, my father turned to gardening.
My father did not havegreen fingers so he spent
a long time reading up on different types Of plants and
the care they needed. He tried growing everything from
small plants to huge fruit trees but he often failed.
However, he (fid not gwe up, He persevered. He mede
sure that he watered the plants regularly and he iso
removed the weeds. Slowly, he became Deuer at
gardering. His plants began to flourish and his fruit
trees Erew. He was very prcud when the first mango
grew from his tree. His efforts were not futile
Besides making sure that the plants were well
taken care of, he also made sure that he removed
stagnant water from the plant pot plates. Every day, he
would also remove the dead with a rake. He kept
the garden very neat.
Working in the garden made my lather very
happy. He liked being surrounded by trees and plmts.
