Singapore got its name many centuries ago when
a Prince called Sang Nila Utama landed on the island. He
saw a Strange creature running into the jungle and
thought it was a lion. Later, he called the island
Singapura which means 'Lion City'.
The Merlion Park is located at the mouth Of the
Singapore River. We can get there by walking along
Queen Elizabeth Walk and crossing the Anderson
Bridge. The head of the Merlion is a lion and the is
a fish. The Merlion stands majestically at the Singapore
River, spewing a continuous stream of water into the
river.
Today, the Merlion Park is a popular tourist
attraction. A row Of eateries is found there, catering to
both locals and tourists. Both the young and old enjoy
spending their day at the Merlion park.
Recently, the Merlion Park will a venue
for new and interesting events. An upcoming event is
the temporary building Of a hotel-like room where the
Merlion is. Guests can then stay in the room and can
see Singapore through the eyes of the Merlion.
