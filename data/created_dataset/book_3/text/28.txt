making sure that I finish my work before I play
computer games. She Will then iron the clothes and

Every evening, she cooks dinner for the family.
She never fails to come uO wth a new dish every week.

settle down in front of the television again to watch
drama serials. Although she goes to bed late, she is
always bright and chirpy the next day. I admire my
