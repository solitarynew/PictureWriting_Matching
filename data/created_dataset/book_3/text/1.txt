Lena and her adventurous siblings visited the
beautiful tropical rainforest at Bukit Timah Nature
Reserve last December. They donned cotton shorts with
socks and hiking shoes. Lena even wore a colourful hat
and her Mickey Mouse sunglasses. They applied insect
repellent and packed many txjttles of water.
The walk was an eye-opener. Despite having read
about rainforests, the children were amazed to see
so many different trees and insects. They discovered
extraordinary trees such as the Seraya trees that grew
up to fifty metres tall. They saw a lot of scary looking
giant forest ants but they were harmless. They also
learnt about the Long-tailed Macaque Monkey and the
giant forest millipede.
Lena asked her brother, "Do you know how tall
Bukit Timah Hill is?" He shook his head. She said, "It is
about 164 metres above sea level and it is made of
granite."
"Wow!" her brother said in amazement.
Lena and her siblings had a terrific time at the
nature reserve. They were able to see so many
creatures and plants that they had only seen before in
reference They could not wait to explore other
places another day.
