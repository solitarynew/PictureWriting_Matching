Jane, Peter and I had been stuck in the house the
whole day. It was raining cats and dogs. Towards the
late afternoon, the rain sub•ded. We put on our shoes
and naited in anticipatim for the rain to stop
completely so that we could go to the park.
It was not lorg before the sun appeared in the
sky. We dashed out of the house eagerlv Peter was
ahead of us, Just Before he reached the park he
stopped in his tracks and gazed up at the sky. Curious,
we Icoked up too. We were to see a rairbow
stretched across the sky. "DO you think there is a pot Of
gold at the end Of the rainbcw?" Jare asked. Peter and I
ignored her. We were 100<ing hard at the rainbow,
trying to count the number Of colours just to check if
there were seven colours. The skv was a clear blue and
large clouds on each side looked as though they were
guarding the rainbow. I wished I had a camera With me
so th*t I could capture the wonderful sight.
It was only when an exceptionally large cloud
began covering the rainbow did we finally tear Our eyes
awa•,• from the rainbow. Remembering What we had left
the Youse to do, we ran to the parkt0 play.
The ground was slightly damp and muddy et the
park but we did not mind. We tound tne alr retreshlng
and cool. We had a great tine skipping at the park.
