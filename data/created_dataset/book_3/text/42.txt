have a Closet in my room where I put all
favourte clothes and num&ous pairs Of shoes. My
parents bought all these clothps and matching shcres for
me du•ing different festive occasions like Christmas and
New Year
My favourite set of zlothes is a polka-dotted
sleeveless blouse and a pair cf denim jeans. The blouse
is yellow and red. I like its oright cheery colours. My
eldest sister purchased them for me on her trip to
Londm last Christmas. She also gave me a pair of
matching shoes, Which I now wear quite Often on my
weekend outings with my family.
Another favourite outfit of mine is a bright red
cheorgsam With pretty flora prints, Which my mo:her
bought recently. I wore it on my ninth birthday and all
mv friends were green With envy. They said I looked
stunning.
I like wearing beautiful clothes. I cannot wait for
those occasions When I can buy new clothes. I am
waiting impatiently for the next one— Christmas. I Nant
to buy a long white gown that I saw at the boutique
that day.
