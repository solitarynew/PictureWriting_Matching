My neighbour, Mr Lirn, Often collects Old
newspapers. He does not sell them. Instead, he uses

Once I entered his hcuse, I saw rows of pl-oto
frames on his wall. There Mere also photo frames on
top Of the cupboards. Each photo frame was unique. I
was about to ask Mr Lim where he tought those photo
frames from When he asked me if I wanted to learn how
to make a photo frame. I wes amazed to learn mat ne
had made all the photo frames himself. 'Yes! Please
teach me!" I exclaimed and clapped my hands in
delight.
Mr Lim took a page from an Old newspaper and
carefullv folded the corners. We had made the sides of
the ghot0 frame. Then, he showed me how to cut
decorative paper and paste them on the newspzper.
We smoothed out the crea√¶s and trimmed the edges.
Latera I painted a coat Ot varnish on the frame. I had
made my own photo frame!
I thanked Mr Lim chowing mp tn make
the photo frame. Clutching it in my hand, I showed it
proudly to my mother when I reached home. "Car. you
teach me how to make one?" she asked. I grinned. I
could not wait to make another photo frame.
