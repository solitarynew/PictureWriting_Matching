My hobby is stamp collecting. This is called
philateb/ and the One Who pursues it is called a
philateist. I was drawn to th s hobby when I was just
five years Old. My uncle gave ne an album Of stamps on
my Olrtnday. I was amezea to see so many beautiful and
interesting stamps in it. That day, I spent the enbre
afternoon going through the album. There were stamps
from all over the world. I likedthem very much.
As I grew Older and my interest developec, I
began to ask everyone for stamps. My friends and
relatives gave me their stamps. However, they were
mostly local ones. I was mo-e interested in overseas
stamps. I tried to get them fro-n my relatives When they
travelled overseas or when they received parcels
overseas. However, my collection grew very slowly.
Then, one dav. mv new nei2hb0ur showed me
her stamp album. She had a massive collection Of
She told me that she Eot them by writing to pen
friends overseas. I deeded toget my own pen friends as
well. NOW, I have pen friends overseas. Their letters
always come With a stamp at the top. This has enabled
me to collect hundreds Of stamps from almost all the
in world
Collecting stamps has also benefitted me in Other
ways. I have an excellent hmowledge Of history and
geography. This has allowed me to score well in school
examinations.
