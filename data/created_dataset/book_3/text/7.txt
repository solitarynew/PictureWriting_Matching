My father often takes my sister and me to the
Singapore Science Centre on weekends. The Science
Centre is an interesting and exciting place. There are
interactive activities that allow visitors to press, slide,
touch, peek and even hit. It is located in the Western
part of Singapore.
Our first stop is usually the Waterworks exhibit.
Unlike the Other exhibits, it is located outdoors. My
sister and I run around playing with the different
gadgets. We like to play near the sprinklers. We get
drenched but we do not mind. We also throw coloured
balls into a huge container of water and watch as they
swirl through a whirlpool.
After the Waterworks exhibit, we will visit the
other indoor exhibits. Last week, we visited a dinosaur
exhibit. The huge hall was filled with colossal dinosaur
fossils. Spotlights shone on them giving them an eerie
look. My sister and I were too frightened to Stay long.
What my sister and I like most is the 'Climbing Einstein'
in the main hall. It is moved by a motor. He climbs up
and down a rope. Although it is a simple exhibit, my
sister and I Often Stop to gaze at it. We think it is
interesting that the motor can make it look like it is
really climbing.
Just before going home, we will go to the fast
food restaurant at the exit for a meal. As we eat, we will
talk about all the exhibits that we have seen. We are
always talking non-stop about the interesting exhibits.
