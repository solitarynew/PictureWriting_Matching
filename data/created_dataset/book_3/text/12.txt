There are many departmental stores in
Singapore. Many of them can be found in the suburbs.
However, the main shopping district is found in the
heart of Orchard Road. Shopping centres line both sides
of the road in this area. Crowds throng the shopping
centres and eateries. The pathways are packed with
people especially on weekends and holidays.
One of the well-known shopping centres is Ngee
Ann City. The popular Japanese departmental store,
Takashimaya, is located there. The store sells everything
trom tood to clothing. My siblings and I love to shop
there as we can always find the things that we want at a
reasonable price. The toy department is well stocked
with many different types of toys, from the latest
electronic games to traditional board games.
We also like to go to Wisma Atria. There is a food
court there with a wide variety of food stalls. The place
is a popular spot for tired shoppers to rest their weary
feet. There is also a youth park in Orchard Road.
Skateboard stunts are usually done there by teenagers.
There are slopes for them to practise their stunts. There
are also cinemas along Orchard Road that screen the
latest movies, These cinemas are usually packed on
weekends. Tickets for late night shows are often sold
out.
My siblings and I go to Orchard Road every
weekend. We will shop, eat, or watch a movie there.
However, we also like to take a stroll along the
footpath, window shop and listen to the buskers at
work.
