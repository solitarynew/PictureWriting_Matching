"l think you're really stupid!" sniggered
Catherine when she saw the marks on my test paper. I
quickl'/ hid my test paper and walked away from her.
Catherine burst out laughing and mocked for being
as I could that I
terrible at cnglish. I quickly
could get away from her.
Catherine has a perpetual sner on her face. She
looks down on everything and everyone and tlinks
highly of herself. She always mocks Others and pæses
sarcastic remarks. Catherine also likes to play tricks on
peopÄ Sne enjoys 5t•Ck.ng our ner leg and trlpping
others. She tripped me se.eral times. Once, I even
bruised my knee but Catherine just laughed and wdked
away
Catherine also does not respect her teachers. She
always calls them names and makes faces at them when
they are not looking. She likes making fun of our Sciænce
teacter, Mr Lim. He is a kind man who never scolds
us. He does not even s:old Catherine when she
mist»haves.
Most Of the time, I s mply ignore Catherine, Yet,
sometimes she really gets on my and I feel like
wringing her neck. However, my parents have remnded
me to be tolerant Of others, especially those Mom
cannot get along With.
