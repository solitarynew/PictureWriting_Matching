Have you ever played in the snow? I have. I spent
an hour playing in a winter wonderland but I never left
Singapore. Do you know how I did that? I went to Snow
City. It is an indoor snow centre with facilities for
snowEX)arding and skiing. It is a great to escape the
hot and humid weather in Singapore.
Last June, my brother and I went to Snow City
with our parents. We wore winter clothes such as thick
woollen sweaters, scarves, gloves and boots. We had an
exhilarating time. My brother and I were able to go
down a slope on snow tubes. At first, I thought that I
was going to fall and I gripped the sides Of the tube as
tightly as I could. When my brother suggested trying
again, I agreed. We had so much fun that we went to
the top of the slope and tried it again and again, The
more often I went down the slope, the less frightened I
was.
Then, we decided to build a snowman. We gave
the snowman a hat and a scarf. We also threw
snowballs at each other. The temperature was very low.
Our faces were flushed and our noses were red from
the cold, but we did not mind.
We were having so much fun that we were
disappointed when our parents told us we had to leave.
Before leaving Snow City, we went to a restaurant for
dinner. Our parents promised to take us there again
during the next holidays. We left with beautiful pictures
of a memorable afternoon.
