Ice-skating is not only fun, it can be enjoyed for a
lifetime. I have seen childrer as young as two years Old
and adults as Old as severw-five years Old enj0/ing
themselves in the ice-skating rink.
Every ueekend, my parents take LU Fuji
palace, which is located on the third storey of
the wrong Entertainment Centre. The complex is
conveniently located near the Jurong East MRT station
and barong East Bus Interchange. Although we li'.e at
the ather end Of Singapore, we do not mind travelling
such long distance to the ice-skating rink.
Before we enter the rink, we have to pay the
entrance fee, put on our skites and wear our gloves. At
first, I needed my parents' help When put on my
skates. However, now I am very good at putting on the
skates myself. My parents, being experienced skaters,
teach me how to glide gracefully, to move forward,
backuards and how to come to a Stop. Altnougn I have
fallen a few times, am determined to be a good ice-
skater.
I want to become either a professional skater or
an instructor in the future. I like ice-skating very much
and hope that I will be able to skate everyday.
