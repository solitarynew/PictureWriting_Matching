I had an enjoyable and exciting weekend last
saturcvay. My parents took mv cousins and me for ar art
competition in pasir Ris Park. I drew and painted What I
saw a-Ound me. There were many people cycling and
jogging in the beautiful Dark and birds singine in rhp
trees.
After the art competition, we headed to the
beach for a swim. The water was cool and refreshing. It
was a sweltering day, but we did not mind because we
were playing in the water. My cousins and splasned
water at one another. We had so much fun that we did
not
we had 'pent an nour in the Water.
After that, we built sandcastles. My cousins and I
had a competition among ourselves to see Who cculd
build lhe biggest sandcastle. Mv cousin, Tom, was an
expert at building sandcast12s. He used just enough
water to make the sand damp so that the castle would
stand properly. He also put one oile of qand n
another to make the castle very tall.
Although I did nct win the sandcastle
competition, I had a Ict of fun playing with my cousins.
hoped that every weekend would be as enjoyable and
exciting as that one.
