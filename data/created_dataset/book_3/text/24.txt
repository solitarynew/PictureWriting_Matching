'I'm going to work no.v," my mother called I
Naved goodbye and told her to have a good day I
watched With pride as my mother left the house in Yer
cream coloured uniform. My mother works in the
hosoitaL She is a nurse Shp hAA hepn wnrkine there for
two decades.
My mother works in the paediatric ward. She
takes care of sick children. She gets to know the
patients personally and empathises Nith them when
they are sick. She has enccwntered many different
nt . Gome Of them will linen to her but
kick up a fuss when they have to take their medicine.
VIY mother will coax them. She tells them stories and
jokes to make them happy.
My mother is very hapgy whenever her patients
recover She will always have a small present for than
betore they leave the hospital. She also advises them on
how to Stay healthy. She almays tells them that she
does nct want to see them in the hospital again.
As for me, although I respect my mother's
being a nurse will never be my cup Of tea. I
Will feel miserable, seeing peogle in agony.
