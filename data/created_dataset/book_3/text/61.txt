foil end crumpled it to form a crinkly surface ar.und
the box. This was going to be the robot's body. After
that, he attached scrne bottle caps to the box to make
the controls. Then, he used the toilet rolls to mak2 the
arms and legs.
Tom let Glenda and Mike help him. Glenda used
smaler boxes to make the feet. Mike cut some coloured
paper to make the robots fingers. He also cut the
colourful sponges to decorete the robot's body. It was a
manficent robot and it ooked exactly like the one
they had seen in the toy Stcre a few days ago.
Glenda and Mike de:ided tc go home to look for
old boxes and other scrap material. They wanted to
male their own robots too.
