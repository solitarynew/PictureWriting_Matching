love to go to Suntec City. The place is designed
like a giant hand with four office towers. This
represents the fingers of the hand, while the Singapore
International Convention Centre represents the thumb.
From the ground, it is hard tc See this, but my parents
showed me news articles about the building with
pictures taken from the sky. think it is an interesting
design.
In the palm of this hand is a ring from which
fortune flows. This is Suntec CitVs Fountain of Wealth.
It is the world's largest fountain and the water shoots
up to thirty metres. The water flows inwards. This
symbolises riches pouring in.
When we visit Suntec City, my father will take me
to the fountain. We will walk down a narrow path. At
the end of the path is the fountain where we can touch
the water. He says it will bring good luck and prosperity.
I hope it is true.
Tomorrow, I will be going to the Fountain of
Wealth again. My aunt has come from Malaysia and my
parents and I are going to show her the fountain. I am
looking forward to going there again.
