I love nature. I enjoy being outdoors and
admiri.g everything that see around me. I think nature
is filled with an amazing array Of colours.
Tho in tho day filled with
Althoueh my friends always say that there are only blue,
white and yellow colours in the sky, I do not agree With
them. There are always marry shades Of a colour. rhe
shades can be subtle or Obvious. I see different hues Of
blue ranging from dark blue to pale blue. The colouri Of
the sun can range from pale yellow to dark orange pst
I like the colours see at the beach as well. I like
to 100k at the soft brown sand and the bluish green sea.
When the sun is eÂ«eptionally bright, its rays are
reflected in the sea. The sea Will look like it is filled Vith
glittering diamonds. Of course, colourful fish that leap
in and out of the water and the green leaves from the
many trees add to the wonderful colours around me
At night, the sky is even more beautiful, It is not
just jet black as some Of my friends would say. The
twinking Stars light up the nght sky, The moon creates
a softvellow Elow in the skv.
I like the colours that I see in nature. Lookirg at
them makes me feel relaxed especially after a hard day
at school.
