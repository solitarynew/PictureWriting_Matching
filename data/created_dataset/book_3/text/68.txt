H21ping out with the household chores is
in my home. Being a single parent, my
mother has taught me to be independent since I was
seven years old.
Every weekend, I would oe in charge of doing the
laundry. would first sort out the dfferent kinds of
clothes. I separate the coloured clothes from the white
clothes. My mother taught me to do this so that the
white cbthes would not get stained if the colours from
the coloured clothes run. After separating the laundry. I
wash "E
would Nasn Ine coloured ones first In the
machine. I would pour deterg81t and softener onto the
clothes. While waiting for the machine to stop, I wodd
use bleach to wash the white c Othes.
Ey the time I am done with the white clothes, the
washing machine would have stopped I would hang all
the clothes on bamboo rcrds ard put them in the garden
to dry.
I do not mind helping OJt at home even I
have to spend my Whole Saturday morning doing the
chores. I know that my mothe- needs my help since
hae tn work verv hard in the office. I feel very prchld
whenever my mother tells me that she is pleased with
how well I am doing the housdaold chores.
