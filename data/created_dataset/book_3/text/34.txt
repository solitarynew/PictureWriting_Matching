Mrs Goh, who taught me English in Primary Cne
and Two, is without doubt my favourite teacher. She
has left a lasting impression on me.
Goh ic a lady, but had a
expression on her face when I first saw her. I was
terrifid for she looked as tnough she was about to
scold me. She had a frown on her face and she was
staring hard at me. Howev.r, soon, I changed â€¢ny
impression of Mrs Goh. I found out that she had a heart
of gold She had a ready smile for us whenever we were
obedient. sne also spoke geMly, raising her voice only
when recessary.
Mrs GO" taught With a passion. She patiertly
explained every topic until she was certain that we had
understood her. She also told us stories about her
childhcod. She often encouraged us to believe in
ourselves. Thus, we began to enjoy learning very
She also did mind listening to our problems after
school, She was always patient and kind.
I have had many other-teachers but Mrs Goh Will
always be my favourite teacher. Every year on Teachers
I V a fm r hpr I
a pop up card for her and wite her a note to tell ler
how rnuch I miss having her as my teacher.
