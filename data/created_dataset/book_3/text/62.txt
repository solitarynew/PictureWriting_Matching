I want to be a chef When I grow up. I Often
imagine myself in a white chefs uniform and hat,
slogging Over a hot Stove.
For now, I spend most cf mv free timp rnnkine 1
learnt how to cook a few years ago. My grandmothær
gives me tips on how to cook simple food like
vegetables and eggs. At first, was afraid of starting the
tire and my grandmother had do it for me. However,
after a while, I realised that it was not dangerous to so
near the fire as long as was careful. I also made sure
that I
tho
wok that water
splatter on me when the wok hot. I spend most Of
my wee«ends cooking. The mcre I practise the better I
become. Now, I do not ever need to measure the
amount Of Oil, water or salt to out in. I am able to pour
just the right amount into the wok.
Vy grandmotner can only tea:h me to cock
Chinese food, I turn to recipe books to learn how
cook Italian food. I like to make pizzas because I can put
whatebU I want on it. My pinas are so good that evat
my grandparents, who only ezt rice, love them, They
like my crispy crust. I also bakepastries. I know just ttæ
right amount of water to mix wth the dough so that the
pastries do not become too hard or too soft. My farni9
and I eat them for tea. I like experimenting with new
ingredients. My family loves rnyfood.
Learning to cook is not an easy task. I have
scalded myself with hot oil many times. However, I Will
perse•.ere. One day, I will become a famous chef.
