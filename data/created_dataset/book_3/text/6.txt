I twirled about in my new pink baju kurung with
purple flowers. I smiled at myself in the mirror and
the dav my parents had taken me to Geylang
They had taken me there to learn more about the
Malay community in Singapore.
There were many Stalls selling Malay clothes in
Geylang Serai. The colourful clothes brightened up the
place. They were hung on bamboo poles. liked a bright
pink baju kurung. My mother decided to buy it for me
after haggling over the price with the seller. I also had a
chance to sample different types of Malay food. My
favourite was the satay stall. I watched as a man with a
songkok on his head and a sarong around his body
fanned the mouth-watering sticks of satay on the grill.
The smoke was choking and it made me cough.
However, I did not mind. I wanted to eat the succulent
sticks of satay. Before long, I was tucking into ten
delicious sticks of satay.
After the meal, my parents took me to the Malay
Village. When I entered the place, it felt as though I was
entering another world. The Kampung Museum and
Art Gallery told me a lot about Malay tradition.
The Kampung Museum was in the middle of the
Malay Village. I saw traditional musical instruments, a
collecticn of weapons used by villagers in the olden
days and a shadow puppet show on the first floor. On
the second floor, I saw the Muslim bridal chamber.
I had a great time at Geylang Serai- I was
reluctant to leave as I still wanted to explore the place.
My parents promised to take me there again.
