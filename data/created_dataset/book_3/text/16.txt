The place that allows you to 'hear the past, see
the present and touch the future' is none other than
the Singapore Discovery Centre. I had heard so much
about it but my parents did not have the time to take
me there. It is located in Jurong which is too far for me
to visit on my own.
was delighted when my parents agreed to take
me there during the holidays. It was my reward for
doing well in the examinations. Together with my
cousin, we left after breakfast on the first day of the
school holidays. We made our way to the Singapore
Discovery Centre by car.
We first entered the gallery where we learnt
about the history Of Singapore. We watched a movie
clip. Then, we went to another gallery. There was a ball
with bright lights. The lights were actually images of life
in Singapore. We also saw an exhibition with huge
robots. They were made of metal. My father said it was
bronze. The robots could move their arms and eyes. My
cousin thought they looked frightening. Finally, we
went to a gallery that showed us pictures of how
much Singapore had achieved. There were pictures of
the Singapore skyline. I felt proud of Singapore's
achievements. There was also a game whereby
contestants had to create their dream city. It looked like
fun. I wanted to try it, but my parents said that it was
time to leave,
I had a pleasant and memorable trip. My parents
told me that the exhibits are changed regularly. They
will take me there again when there are new exhibits. I
am spurred on to do well in my studies because of this
