"Pupils, what do you know about the SingagK)re
River and the area around it?" Miss Png asked. All of us
rushed to answer her question. We were eager to tell
her what we knew.
"It is about three kilometres long and there are
many bridges spanning it. The Elgin Bridge is the first
bridge that was built across it," our smart monitor
answered immediately.
"My father said that during the days when
traders travelled to and from Singapore, the river was
crammed with cargo boats and ccx.lies unloading coal,
rubber and spices," I added.
"Well, I saw the spire of the St. AndreWs
Cathedral when my parents tcH)k me on a tour of the
area. also went to the Merlion park to see the Merlion.
There were two of them. I saw a big one at the
Singapore River and a much smaller one a short
distance away," Alex exclaimed.
"l think there is a statue of Raffles in front of
the Victoria Memorial Hall, right?" Cynthia, a shy
student in my class, asked uncertainly.
"All of you are correct!" Miss Png said in delight.
"We are going to explore the area around the Singapore
River during our next class trip. You will learn more
about the history of Singapore then.
All of us clapped our hands excitedly. There was
a buzz Of excitement in the class as everyone began
talking about what they would see on the trip.
