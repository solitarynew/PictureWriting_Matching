I am one Of the few Who like the rainy
weather. I love it when it pours. When a downpcur
sends people scurrying indoors, I Will Stay outdocrs,
feeling the rain beat down on me.
like to listen to the pitter-patter Of the
raindrcvs as they fall cn the ground. love to watch the
splashes they make When th2V,' hit the ground. What
never tails to amaze me is how the many droplets Of
rain Will form huge puddles on the ground. I Ike
splashing about On the puddles Of water. Many people
will under umbrellas or hurry in
raincoats and galoshes but I am different. I will walk
with head held high in the rain. I am not bothered
by raiMrops splashing on my face and trickling dmvn
my body. I do not mind being drenched. Sometimes, I
deliberately go for a walk in the rain.
-lowever, my liking for the rain is not shared by
my mother. Whenever she is at home, she forbids me
from going out in the rain. She says that playing in the
rain Will make me ill, She is right. I do fall ill whenever
play in the rain. However, that has never deterred me
from gDing outto play the next time it rains.
I am excited whenever see dark clouds gathe- in
the sky. I know that itis going to rain and I cannot wait
to go aut to play. I always sneak out whenever no ane
notices for a great time in therain. wonder when it will
rain again.
