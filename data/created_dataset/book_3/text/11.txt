Dear Agnes,
In your previous letter, you said that you would
be coming to Singapore. I can't wait for you to visit us.
There are so many things I want to do with you. Most
importantly, my sister and I want to take you to the
Night Safari.
The Night Safari is Singapore's night zoo. Unlike
the usual zoo, the Night Safari is only open at night. I
went there a few times with my parents. It is an
interesting and exciting place to visit, but it can be a
little scary sometimes. We can have dinner at the Night
Safari as there is a variety of food outlets there.
We can either walk along the trails or take a
tram. I suggest we take the tram first so that we will
have a good idea of what the park is like. Then, we can
stop at any of the tram stations and follow the walking
trails there. Although it is dark and there are animals
walking about freely, the animals will not harm anyone
if they are not provoked. There are many keepers
stationed along the walkways to guide visitors along the
trails,
I have been to the Night Safari a few times but
each time is still interesting and exciting. There are so
many nocturnal animals. I always find something new
to see.
hope to see you soon. Let me know when you
are coming to Singapore. I cannot wait to see you!
Love,
Megan
