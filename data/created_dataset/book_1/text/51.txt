There are six members in my family, including me. I have my grandparents, my parents and an elder sister. We live in Serangoon in a five room flat.
My grandparents are seventy years old and they are very fit and healthy. They go to the park to exercise every morning. Grandpa will jog while grandma will do her brisk walking. My father works as a computer engineer while my mother is a nurse. They are very busy with their work.
My elder sister is in Primary Three and I am in Primary One. We go to the same school. Every morning, we take the same bus to school together.
Over the weekends, we spend time together. We will go shopping at the nearby mall for groceries or sometimes we travel further out to shopping centres in town. We also go swimming or have picnics at the beach.
Next month, we will be going to Malaysia for a short holiday and I am looking forward to it!
