It was recess time. The pupils of Primary 1F were running to the school field. They were going to have their skipping session. This was something they did daily.
Their Physical Education teacher had told them about the importance of exercising regularly. He introduced some sports such as swimming, jogging and playing badminton to the pupils. The pupils, aware of the importance of exercise, had been taking up such additional exercises.
Besides exercising, they also watch their diet. These pupils eat more fruit and vegetables and avoided eating fried food. Within two months, they felt a difference. They felt that they were fitter and healthier.
They started to share with their friends from other classes about the importance of exercise and invited them to join them in their daily skipping session.
