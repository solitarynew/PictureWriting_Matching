Shirley and Keith were excited. It was National Day, a day to celebrate Singapore's independence. They had always been excited when it was National Day as they knew that they would be able to watch a spectacular fireworks display.
Just the day before in school, they had celebrated by watching concerts and having some games. The teachers also told them of the hard times early Singaporeans faced to help the country gain independence.
Shirley and Keith were very proud of Singapore's achievements as well as being Singaporeans. That was why they would always sign up for the celebration in the neighbourhood.
In the evening, after dinner, they brought the flags that they had made and went down to join the crowd. Everyone was dressed in red and white. They sang National Day songs and there were games for every resident to take part. There were also some performances by pupils and residents. It was indeed an entertaining concert. There was also a mega television screen, showing the actual National Day Parade that was held at the Padang. Everyone cheered when the fireworks display was shown. Over at where they were, there was a smaller scale of fireworks, making the atmosphere livelier.
Soon, it was time to go home. Shirley and Keith bade their neighbours farewell. They had a great time and they could not wait for the National Day next year.
