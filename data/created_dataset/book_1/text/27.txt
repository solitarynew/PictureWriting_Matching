The bell for dismissal rang and Gerald was on his way home. He was walking quickly as he had a tuition class later. When he reached a busy junction, he saw an old man with a walking stick. The old man seemed as though he was going to cross the road.
Gerald approached him and asked politely, "Hello, can I help you?" The old man turned and Gerald realised that he was wearing dark glasses and from Gerald's observation, he knew the man was blind.
"Oh, hi, I have just moved into this area and I am still not very familiar with this area. I am going to Block 24," the old man said with a smile.
"That's quite near my place, let me take you there," Gerald offered. The old man nodded his head.
Gerald held his arm and he remembered what his teacher had once told him. They should not walk ahead or too fast when they are guiding the blind. The old man chatted with him while they walked. Gerald helped him across a pedestrian crossing and they continued walking to the block. When they reached the block, Gerald asked the old man if he knew which level he was going to and the old man nodded his head. Just before he left, the old man praised Gerald for his kindness. He said that he was very grateful to Gerald for helping him find his way home. Gerald was very proud that he had done a good deed. After saying goodbye, he ran all the way home, eager to share with his mother what had happened.
