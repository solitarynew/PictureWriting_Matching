My best friend is Huiling. I have known her since kindergarten days. We went to the same class then and it so happened that our parents also enrolled us in the same primary school.
As our results were about the same, we have been in the same class for three years. Huiling and I share a lot of common interests. For example, we have the same hobby, reading . We love books so much that we go to the library together every Saturday.
We share the same favourite author too. Huiling and I walk to school every morning together. She will wait for me at my void deck and then we will talk and walk to school. I enjoy her company very much.
Huiling takes good care of me and she has always regarded me as her younger sister since I was born a few months after her. I remember once, when we went to the library. I was reading a book when a boy came running and stepped on the book that I was reading. When I told him to move away, he threatened to hit me. Just then, Huiling came along and in her big sisterly voice, she demanded the boy apologise to me or she would report to the librarian. The boy was frightened and he immediately turned to me and apologised before running away quickly.
I appreciate her for all the care and I hope that we will be in the same class for the next three years in our primary school and hopefully, go to the same secondary school too!
