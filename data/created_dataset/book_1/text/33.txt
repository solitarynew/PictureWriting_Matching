Benjamin and his classmates were standing in twos, waiting for their form teacher to count the number of pupils in the class before they boarded the bus. All the pupils were very excited as they were going on a school excursion.
Once the number of pupils were correct, they boarded the bus. In the bus, Mrs Teo, their form teacher, told them that they were going to the Singapore Zoological Gardens. She started to distribute some worksheets which the pupils had to complete at the zoo.
After a half an hour journey, they reached their destination. The pupils hopped off the bus, all in a happy mood. Mrs Teo purchased the admission tickets and then they went in.
Benjamin and his classmates broke into groups and they began to work on their worksheet. They went to different enclosures to find out more about some animals. When Benjamin was at the elephants' enclosure, he was delighted to see an elephant performing! It was funny. They also saw some giraffes and from the information board, they found out many interesting facts about giraffes.
After they had completed their worksheet, they went to watch an animal show. It was a show that everyone enjoyed. They participated in the games and they were surprised to see how well behaved the animals were.
After a long and tiring day, they went to the fast food restaurant to have their lunch. Benjamin enjoyed his lunch and all his classmates enjoyed this excursion tremendously.
