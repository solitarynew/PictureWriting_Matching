It was the June holidays. Peter woke up to the chirping of the birds. He felt so comfortable and well- rested. It was a treat to be able to wake up slightly later in the morning.
He got out of bed, washed up and then headed to the dining room where his parents were. He greeted them and sat down for breakfast.
"What are we going to do today?" Peter asked his father. He knew that his father had taken leave to accompany him. His father thought for a while before saying, "We can go to the beach for a picnic or maybe catch a movie. However, you must help with some chores first."
"Oh sure, can I help to wash your car?" Peter said. He loved helping his father wash the car. It was fun. He jumped in delight when his father nodded his head.
After breakfast, Peter changed into some light clothes and began washing the car with his father. After the initial washing, they applied some wax on the car to make it shiny. It was hard work but Peter felt that it was rewarding. His father patted him on his head and thanked him for the good job.
It was already lunch time. His mother had prepared lunch and his father suggested that they have lunch before going to the mall nearby to catch a movie. They enjoyed the sumptuous lunch that his mother had prepared. After that, they headed for the mall.
When they reached the mall, they went to the cinema and looked through the advertisements to decide what show to watch. Finally, they decided to watch "Ice Age 3".
