"Ring!" the alarm clock rang. Sam woke up and looked at his alarm clock, it was six thirty in the morning. He wondered if he was late. Then he remembered that it was the start of the school holidays! He smiled to himself as he had always looked forward to the holidays.
He rested for a while more before he went to his parents' room. As they were teachers, they also did not have to go to school. He woke them up and asked them what they were going to do. His father smiled at him and then asked him if he wanted to go to beach. Sam immediately shouted a loud yes and his father chuckled. He told him to wake his younger brother up and get ready.
"Sean! Wake up! We are going to the beach!" Sam shouted. His brother woke up, rubbed his eyes and looked at him. Sam repeated what he had said and Sean jumped out of bed immediately. He loved swimming and playing with sand.
After they had packed up and their mother had prepared some drinks and light snacks, they were on their way to the East Coast Beach. On the way, they joked and laughed. All of them loved school holidays.
When they reached the beach, it was rather crowded but they still managed to find a good spot to place their mat and belongings. Sam built a sandcastle with his mother while his father taught Sean how to swim. It was great fun.
After about two hours, they sat down to have some light snacks and drinks. Shortly, Sam asked if he could try cycling as there was a kiosk nearby that rented bicycles. His father nodded his head and in no time, the family was on the cycling track.
At the end of the day, it was a fun time at the beach and they enjoyed themselves tremendously.
