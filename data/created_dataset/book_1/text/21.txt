"Oh no! It's seven o'clock! I am going to be late for school!" Ming Wei shouted as he jumped out of bed. He had slept late the night before as he had stayed up to watch a movie. He regretted not listening to his mother's advice.
He hurriedly changed into his uniform, grabbed his bag and ran all the way to school. Halfway through, he realised that he had forgotten to bring his English homework. As he did not want to be reprimanded by his teacher, he decided to run back home to get it. After all, he was already late.
After getting his file, he was on his way to school again. As he entered the school gate, he saw his discipline master patrolling the school grounds. He apologised to the discipline master and promised to be punctual again.
When he entered the class, his teacher was busy writing on the board, "Mathematics Test". Ming Wei was shocked. He certainly was not prepared for it! Ming Wei walked to his seat and he looked around at all his classmates but no one was bothered by him as they were busy with their last-minute revision. Ming Wei sat down and knew he was in trouble. He could only hope that the test would not be too difficult. When the paper was distributed, he sighed. It was questions that the teacher had taught but Ming Wei had not revised any so he could not do most of the sums.
At the end of the day, he received his test results. He was the only one in the class who had failed! He scored only five marks out of twenty! He knew he was going to be in trouble when his mother saw his results. He told himself to get ready to face the music.
