"Good morning, class, I am your new Mother Tongue teacher, Miss Lee," the gentle female teacher said to class 48. Mark, the naughtiest in class, gave a smile and looked away. The other pupils merely smiled and no one said anything.
Miss Lee then began lesson on chapter one. She continued teaching and writing on the board and did not pay attention to the class. A boy was looking out of the window, totally uninterested in what the teacher was going to teach. A girl fell asleep while another boy was busy with his artwork.
When the teacher turned around, she was shocked to see the different pupils doing things on their own. None was really interested in her lesson. She was disappointed. She cleared her throat and then some of them looked at her.
Miss Lee decided that she must do something about this attitude of the pupils. She began talking to the pupils and also shared with them the importance of studying hard. She told the pupils that respect and discipline were very important too. Instantly, a few of the mischievous pupils apologised to her. Miss Lee forgave them.
At the end of the day, Miss Lee was pleased that she had brought to the pupils' attention things that were not taught in a textbook. She looked forward to the next day, hoping that the pupils would really keep to their promises and behave themselves.
