"Celine, please look after your brother while we are out," Celine's parents said as they left the house. Celine nodded her head reluctantly. She dreaded looking after her brother as he was always very playful and mischievous.
When her parents left, she sat down on the sofa and watched her favourite television programme, ignoring her brother totally. Her younger brother, Deon, was running all over the house. Celine prayed hard - that he would not run into any of her mother's favourite vases.
All of a sudden, she heard a loud shout followed by a loud crash. Her worst fears had come true! She turned and looked and saw her brother sitting down on the floor, his face was pale. She looked around and found that he had broken his mother's vase, though not her most expensive or favourite.
She was fuming mad. She did not understand why her brother was so naughty and active. Feeling angry, she ran into her room and took out a wooden ruler. She stormed towards him and started pointing at him accusingly. "You! You horrid boy! Why can't you sit down and watch television?" she screamed.
Her brother did not answer except to stare at her. She was angry and began to smack him with the wooden ruler. She hit him so hard that the wooden ruler broke into two!
By then, her brother was wailing in pain. Celine's heart beat violently as she stared at the two pieces of the wooden ruler. What were her parents going to say? As she was still angry, she sent her brother into his room and told him to stay there while she cleaned up the mess.
When she had finished, she went into her brother's room and spoke to him. She explained to him the reason for her anger. He apologised to her for being such a mischievous child. He also said that he would explain to their parents when they got home.
