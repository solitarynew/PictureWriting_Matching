My hobby is collecting soft toys. In fact, I have been collecting soft toys since I was four years old. It started when my uncle bought me a soft toy of my favourite cartoon character from Japan. I loved it so much that I decided to collect more soft toys. It took me quite some time as it was not easy to get what I wanted and liked.
To date, I have about forty soft toys and most of them are gifts. As my family members and relatives know that I love soft toys, they will make it a point to buy me one when they are overseas. I display all my soft toys in a cabinet that my parents had specially made for me.
Whenever I feel bored or sad, I will take them all out, give them a cuddle and put them all back. I also try to change the position of where they are placed so that it will not be too boring.
Last December, my parents took me to Disneyland in America and I was surprised with the wide variety of soft toys there. Some were as huge as I was. As I could only buy one soft toy, I took a long time to choose and finally settled on a Minnie Mouse soft toy. My favourite is still the one my uncle bought. Unfortunately, it is a little torn and tattered as I carried it to sleep every night. Nevertheless, I will still treasure it as it is my first and beloved soft toy.
I think having a hobby is very important for everyone, regardless of your age. It is something that you can look forward to when you are very stressed and want to relax.
