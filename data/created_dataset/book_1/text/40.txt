John had just returned home from school. Without changing into his home clothes, he began playing computer games. When he realised that his parents were coming home, he hurriedly went to the study table and took out all his homework. He tried to do his work quickly so that he could play again.
Unfortunately, his father needed to use the computer so he had no choice but to do something else. He decided to take a shower and then see what he could do.
After a while, he got bored and his father did not seem to be finishing soon so John went to his bed and lay down, reading a comic book.
Just then, his mother walked in and saw the mess the room was in. She ordered John to clean up the study table. John said, "Ok, give me five minutes."
Ten minutes later, his mother came in again and was angry that he was still in bed, reading and the mess was still there! His mother was so furious that she dragged him out of bed. She stood beside him as he cleaned up the table. While he was packing, his mother spotted some homework that was incomplete. She was angry. She told him, "No more games for you! You have to prove to me that you can clean up your room and be responsible for your work before you can play computer games again!" She was really angry and disappointed.
John realised that he had been too lazy. He promised that he would try to change. His mother nodded her head and walked out of the room.
