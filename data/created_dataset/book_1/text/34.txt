It was the last day of school. Pupils from 4B from Merry Land Primary School were busy cleaning up their classroom. It was their annual spring cleaning day. Every year, pupils from each class had to clear the classroom, making it spick and span for the class next year.
Henry, the class monitor, was in charge of the cleaning for the class. He had asked his classmates to bring some rags to school. When all his friends arrived, he told them their duties and they all began.
Some of them wiped the windows while others cleaned the tables and chairs. Another group checked the cupboards to ensure that there was no rubbish left behind. It was hard work but the pupils talked and joked to pass time and to make the whole activity more fun and relaxing.
Their form teacher came in shortly and she was proud that the pupils were on task and there was no one playing. She thanked them for their efforts.
At the end of the day, Henry and his classmates were exhausted but when they saw that the classroom was clean again, they were very sure that it was worth their effort.
