Lionel and his brother were on their way home after their tuition class. They were feeling hungry as it was near their dinner time.
When they reached home, they were glad that their mother was cooking in the kitchen. They went to take a shower so that dinner would be ready by then.
Half an hour later, they were all seated at the dining table, enjoying the dinner that their mother had prepared. As they ate, they talked about what had happened in the day. Lionel, as usual, was cracking jokes, making everyone laugh.
After they had finished all the food, their mother cut some fruits for them to eat. Lionel's brother asked his mother why they had to eat fruits every day. Lionel's mother explained that fruits are a good source of vitamins and fibre. She added that it was better to take two servings of fruit at every meal.
Lionel then asked his mother if she could prepare some fruit for them every day for school. His mother laughed and nodded her head.
