"Kenny, remember to meet on that website I gave you!" Jason bellowed as he bade Kenny goodbye. The two boys recently started a new online game and had become addicted ever since.
Back at home, Kenny began to hurriedly complete his homework so that he could have more time for the game later. When he had completed his homework, he immediately switched on the computer and began playing his games. He chatted with his friend, Jason, as they played. Kenny also found out that many of his friends were online too.
He was so engrossed in the game that he forgot all about dinner and when his maid came into the room to remind him, it was already eight o'clock. He ate while playing the game.
Two hours later, his mother returned home. She was surprised to see that the light in Kenny's room was still switched on. She went in and was shocked to see Kenny at the computer desk, staring intently at the computer screen.
"What are you doing? It is already ten o clock!" , she lectured. Kenny smiled sheepishly and then assured her that he was going to log off in five minutes.
When his mother returned in about ten minutes, she was angry that he was still at the game. She warned him that she would take away the computer if he did not stop immediately. Kenny had no choice but to do as he was told.
His mother then checked his bag and she was extremely upset when she found many careless mistakes in Kenny's work. She told him angrily that he would not be able to play computer games for a month.
Kenny sighed upon hearing that. However, he had no choice. He deeply regretted his actions.
