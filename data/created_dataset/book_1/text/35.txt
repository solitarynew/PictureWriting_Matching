Sarah was watching television programmes again. She loved watching cartoons especially and even though her mother warned her many times, she would forget about her mother's warnings.
Sarah knew that her examination was going to be held next week but she just wanted to watch one episode of her favourite cartoon series before she did her revision. Furthermore, she was doing corrections for her spelling while watching.
A few minutes later, her furious mother stormed in and upon seeing that she was still there, she warned her to go into her room immediately to revise. Sarah pleaded with her to let her watch but her mother refused.
Sarah asked why her brother could watch and she could not. Her mother replied angrily that her brother was not sitting for any examination the following week. Sarah had nothing else to say so she packed up her books and went into the room. She sat at the study desk and did her corrections.
When she was done with her corrections, she took out her book to revise. Just then, she heard the familiar music of another programme which she loved. She ran to the door and peeped out. Mother was not there so she stood at the doorway and watched the programme.
All of a sudden, she felt someone twist her ears. It was her mother! Her mother scolded her and told her the importance of studying. Sarah felt bad so she apologised to her mother and promised her mother that she would study hard from then on.
