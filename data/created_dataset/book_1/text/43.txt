"Mum, what are you doing?" Jane asked with curiosity.
Jane's mother told her that she was baking some mooncakes. She explained how people started eating mooncakes. Jane was interested and as she helped her mother knead the dough, she listened carefully to her mother's stories.
After an hour, the kitchen was filled with the aroma of the freshly-baked mooncakes. By then, Jane had listened to many stories about the Mid Autumn Festival. She was excited when her mother told her that they would buy some lanterns and light them up in the evening.
In the evening, once Jane's father returned from work, they brought their mooncakes and lanterns down to the park. There were already many people at the park, with the lighted lanterns. Children were walking about, talking and laughing. Adults sat at stone tables, enjoying the beautiful night scenery and the full moon. Some of them also brought mooncakes of all sorts of flavours to share. Jane's mother got some of the neighbours to try her mooncakes. Jane and her brother decided to join some of the children in a lantern walk. They all lighted up their lanterns and walked around the park. It was a beautiful sight! Everyone was feeling happy.
Soon, it was time to go home. Jane and her brother were rather tired from the walk but they had enjoyed themselves tremendously.
