It was the school holiday. Sam and his family were at home, having breakfast together. Sam's father said, "Let's go to the park after breakfast. We haven't been there for a long time." Sam and his sister cheered.
Soon, they were on their way to the park. When they reached there, the park was quite crowded as many people were there for their morning walks and some were fishing in the lake nearby.
Sam's parents took them to the playground and the two children began playing on the slide. It was fun as they hardly got a chance to play at the playground. Furthermore, they were quite lucky that there were not many children there on that day. They also went on swings and had a competition on who could swing higher. Finally, they went on the see-saw and had a whale of a time.
After all that, Sam's father said they should take a brisk walk around the park. The air was cool and crisp. There were birds singing and the scenery was beautiful. Many people were involved in jogging and 'taiji' exercises. As they walked, they also chatted. Sam's sister was skipping merrily along the track and from time to time, she would smell the beautiful flowers. When they reached the other end of the park, they bought a few bottles of drinks from the kiosk and sat down to drink.
Soon, they were on their way back again. After they had finished their walk, Sam's mother suggested that they go to the market to buy some groceries for the week.
