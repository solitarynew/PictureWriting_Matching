It was a public holiday. Wayne was feeling bored as there was nothing to do. His father, seeing that he had been watching television the whole day, decided to take him to the park.
"Let's go to the park," his father said. Wayne asked him what they were going to do. His father took out a kite and told him that it was a kite that he had made in a kite-making competition. He suggested that they fly the kite in the park nearby. Wayne thought that sounded interesting so he agreed. Wayne's mother tagged along too.
At the park, it was windy and there were people who were flying kites too. Wayne's father managed to let the kite fly. Wayne jumped and shouted in delight when he saw the kite dancing in the air.
All of a sudden, the wind changed direction and Wayne's father was shocked when his kite was blown towards a tall tree. In no time, it was stuck in the tree. Wayne's father tried hard to get the kite free but to no avail. He tugged gently continuously, for fear that he might damage the kite but there seemed no way the kite was going to be free. Left with no choice, Wayne's father said that he would have to climb up the tree. Wayne's mother was against it as she felt it was too dangerous. However, Wayne knew that his father loved the kite a lot so he encouraged his father to do it.
Soon, Wayne's father was up in the tree and he managed to retrieve the kite. Wayne cheered loudly. He also told his father to be careful when coming down from the tree.
After that, they proceeded to go home as Wayne's father was very tired from all the climbing. Though they did not get to fly the kite for a long time, Wayne thought it was a special day.
